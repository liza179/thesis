issued by first-tier companies. There is also an increase in pawn loan administrators of $76 million (5.1%), which represents the largest increase since January 2000. Similarly, mortgage loans registered their smallest decline since the crisis occurred, of only $27 million (-0.3%).

- In nominal terms, the peso showed for the third consecutive month a monthly appreciation against the US dollar (0.5%), while it depreciated in relation to the real (1.7%) and the euro (3.3%). On the other hand, according to the evolution of the Multilateral Real Exchange Rate Index, the peso depreciated 2.2% against the basket of currencies of its main trading partners, accumulating a depreciation of 6.5% over the last 12 months.

Monthly Monetary Report – NOVEMBER 2004

2. Monetary Program

In November, the Broad Monetary Base (BMA) increased $571 million (1.2%) and was positioned at $47,241 million, a level 5.5% higher than that recorded one year earlier. The monthly growth evidenced by this variable was the reflection of the increase of $370 million in monetary circulation in the hands of the public and of $201 million in banking reserves in pesos.

Chart 2.1 The factors of variation of the BMA showed behavior similar to that observed Factors of Explanation of the Broad Monetary Base throughout the entire year, that is, public and financial sectors (thousands of millions of $ contractionary and the external sector as the main expansion factor.

During the course of the month, financial entities continued channeling part of their excess liquidity into repo operations with the BCRA, which implied a decrease in the BMA of $235 million. Likewise, the banks that adhered to the rediscount cancellation mechanism, known as "matching," continued paying the corresponding installments, which also led to a contraction of the BMA of $204 million.

The public sector continued financing part of the payments it made to International Financial Institutions (IFI) with deposits it had available in the local banking system, which contributed to a decrease of $524 million of the BMA in November.

Unlike what occurred in the two previous months, the net placement of LEBAC and NOBAC again showed a contractionary monetary effect of $496 million.

Chart 2.2
Broad Monetary Base and Monetary Program

The net purchase of foreign currency from the private sector was the only factor (thousands of millions of $) that involved monetary expansion in November and, for this reason the BMA increased $2,022 million (see Chart 2.1).

58 Observed (BMA + Passive Repos)
56 Observed - 30-day Moving Average The BMA adjusted for repos, defined as the sum of the BMA and passive repos, registered a level of $53,046 million. This figure is 1.6% higher than that of October and 18.4% higher than that corresponding to the same period of the previous year. Likewise, this aggregate continued to be within the trajectory provided in the Monetary Program (see Chart 2.2).

3.1. Interest Rates

In the repo market, the BCRA continued operating in the 7-day segment with the objective of setting a short-term interest rate corridor, granting active repos at 3% and taking passive repos at 2.5%. In the 1-day maturity segment, an increase in traded amounts was observed, a fact that was made possible by the regulatory changes promoted by the BCRA to facilitate this operation, while the interest rate decreased slightly (0.2 p.p.) to a level of 2.06% and decreased its volatility. Likewise, in the call market the traded amount was reduced since part of the funds previously traded in that market began to be channeled through the repo market. Passive interest rates

The lower activity observed in the call market during
November also responds, in part, to the fact that some operators
began to channel through the repo market part of the
financing that they previously conducted through the call market,
a fact that was made possible by the regulatory modification
aimed at facilitating repo operations between third parties (see
section 3.2.1).

Chart 3.2.2.3 In the 1-business-day segment (which concentrates 63% of total)
greater volatility is observed than in previous months (see

3.3. Passive Interest Rates

In November, the excess liquidity existing in the market
resulted in variations in passive interest rates. In this way, in the
30 to 59-day segment and in the longer-term segment
(more than 90 days) slight decreases were evident; while in the
60 to 89-day bracket the interest rates remained

In the 60 to 89-day bracket, which concentrates 10% of total
operations, the level of new agreements decreased 11% and the
average interest rate increased 1 percentage point, reaching 3.5%. This
increase resulted from the change in the relative participation of each
depositor group in the total amount traded. Although all
depositors observed slight decreases in the interest rates received,
the increase in the volume traded by financial service institutions,
which receive an interest rate above the average, and the decrease in
the amount traded by the remaining depositors, led to an increase in
the average interest rate of this segment.

 placements greater than $1 million, this meant a contraction
 of 1 p.p. compared to the previous month and was driven by
 private entities, whose interest rate went from 4.4% to 4.1%, while

 compared to a year ago. With regard to credit card financing,
 there is not yet information available to estimate the average
 interest rate for November, but according to the last available
 information, corresponding to September, it registered a slight
 decline of 0.4 p.p. in that month.

 Finally, the interest rates on financings with real guarantees
 observed slight declines. In the case of mortgages, the interest rate,
 which had not declined since July, presented a slight drop of 0.7 p.p.
 Graph 3.4.3 to stand at 11.9% (see Graph 3.4.3). As for pledged loans, their

TNA, % (Average monthly interest rate weighted by amount) interest had experienced a sharp reduction in October,

 November and is explained, fundamentally, by the policy of some

 Chattel financing at zero rate through the financial company of the group.

20 Thus the interest rate was placed at 11%, which implies a decline of
 0.4 p.p. with respect to the previous month.

 4.1. Monetary Aggregates in Pesos

 In November the monetary aggregates continued
 growing. Both the means of payment (M2) as well as the broader
 aggregate (M3) presented positive variations, driven
 mainly by the inflow of public funds coming from
 tax collection and, to a lesser extent, by the increase in deposits
 from the private sector and cash in circulation.

 in the balances in savings accounts. While sight deposits
30 of the private sector presented a decline of $220 million, which

25 resulted from the difference between the increase of $20 million in the

20 placements in savings accounts and the decrease of $240 million in the

15 deposits in current account. The variations in these deposits

10 contain an important carryover factor, since during October

 Source: BCRA strong transfer of sight deposits occurred toward
 short-term fixed deposits. In November, said deposits
 presented an intramonthly behavior similar to that of the
 previous months, although softened by the arrangement of short-term
 fixed deposits with funds that previously were deposited
 on sight. It should be noted that in the last days of November an
 increase in transactional deposits was observed, which would be linked to the
 greater liquidity needs anticipated by companies for the
 month of December as a consequence of the payment of salaries and
 year-end bonuses. This generated positive variations between end of month, in the
 order of $330 million in the case of private current account and
 $270 million in the case of private savings account.

 7 Monthly Monetary Report –NOVEMBER 2004

 As a consequence of the increase in total sight
 placements and the increase of $370 million in cash in circulation,
 M2 presented an increase of $810 million, which in
 year-on-year terms translated into a growth of 32.4%, 3.1
 p.p. lower than that of the previous month. In this way, the
 deceleration of the year-on-year growth rate that began
 mid-year continues to be evident (see Chart 4.1.1).

 For its part, fixed-term deposits presented, for the
 Chart 4.1.2 third consecutive month, an important increase that reached $1,210

 segment is also noted. In fact, the stock of fixed-term
 deposits in the 30 to 59 day segment increased by $470 million,
 of which $300 million corresponded to public sector funds and
 $166 million to private sector funds. In the case of the public
 sector, this behavior is of a seasonal nature and is associated
 with the need to expand the margin of fund availability for the
 following month, in order to be able to meet the larger
 expenditures associated with the payment of bonuses. Indeed, half
 of the new fixed-term deposits of the public sector agreed in this
 term segment came from deposits originally made in the 60 to 89
 day segment whose maturity took place in the month under
Gráfico 4.1.3 analysis. In the case of the private sector, the increase results

 50 days placements from the private sector. When analyzing this
 50
 segment in more detail, growth of $220 million is seen in the 90

 180 days. (see Chart 4.1.2). These segments include CER-
 30 adjustable deposits, which recorded growth of $480 million,
 corresponding entirely to the private sector. The large inflow of

 funds towards the longer-term segments contributed to extending

 reached since mid-2001 (see Chart 4.1.3).

 The increase in fixed-term placements was partly
 offset by the decrease of $270 million in the stock of
 CEDRO with CER, which resulted in a net increase of time
 deposits of $940 million. Said increase together with the rise
 of $10 million in other deposits and the increase of $810
 million in means of payment generated growth of $1,760 million
 in the broadest monetary aggregate (M3). In year-over-year

If analyzed by deposit type, the November increase is explained mostly by fixed-term placements whose monthly increment reached US$43 million, corresponding to the 30 to 59-day bracket. In this regard, between renewals and new placements the amount of fixed-term deposits operated in November was US$700 million (6% more than last month) registering an increase in the volume operated by the public sector, mostly in the bracket of more than US$1 million, of 30 to 60 days (see Graph 4.2.2). The average term of capture rose to 44 days (resulting 3 days higher than that of October).

For its part, demand deposits registered an increase of US$17 million with which the total stock of deposits in foreign currency reached in November US$3,800 million, accumulating an increase in what has been so far in 2004 of approximately 100%.

## 4.3. Bank Liquidity

Bank liquidity in pesos (defined as the sum of cash in banks, current accounts in the BCRA and reverse repurchase agreements of banks with the BCRA) reached in November 23.4% of total deposits, a level similar to that of last month and half a percentage point below that observed at the end of 2003. Analyzed by bank group, in November public banks maintained liquid resources of 24.8% of their deposits (unchanged from last month) while private banks did so at 22.0% of their deposits (0.2 p.p. more than in October and 1.7 p.p. more than in September) (See Graph 4.3.1). Unlike October, month in which 50% of the increase in liquidity of private banks was allocated to increasing current accounts in the BCRA, this month the entirety of the increase in liquidity of the same concentrated in reverse repurchase agreements with the BCRA. Thus private banks maintained 12% of their total liquidity in reverse repurchase agreements with the BCRA (against 10% in October and only 6% in September). For the total system, liquid resources maintained in reverse repurchase agreements represent 25% of total liquidity.

Regarding the Minimum Cash requirements mandated by the BCRA, for a third consecutive month the position in pesos showed itself invariant at 1.7% of total deposits. The minimum cash surplus in pesos concentrated mostly in private banks that maintained an excess of liquid funds of approximately 2% of deposits (slightly lower than October). For their part, public banks registered a surplus above what is required by the BCRA of around 1.4% of their deposits (slightly higher than last month) (see Graph 4.3.2).

By contrast, in the segment of deposits in dollars the liquidity surplus continues to be very ample and in November was around US$2,000 million⁴, also showing itself invariant for a fourth consecutive month. Specifically, financial entities maintained integrated in their accounts

4 In accordance with what was established by the BCRA, the failure to apply the lending capacity in foreign currency that financial entities verify in a given period is subject to an equivalent increase in the requirement for minimum cash of said period. For this reason, the excess liquidity that financial entities accrue normatively is less than that mentioned in this section in which only the requirement is computed that arises from applying the reserve coefficients on obligations in foreign currency, without considering the increase in the same equivalent to the failure to apply resources.

5 According to Communication A 4168 banks could apply their foreign currency lending capacity to the financing of exports, inter-bank loans, BCRA Letters in dollars, financial trusts whose underlying assets are loans intended for export financing, loans to producers of final or intermediate goods that have endorsements from exporters and debt securities or participation certificates in financial trusts issued in foreign currency and with public offering authorized by the National Securities Commission whose underlying assets are constituted by documents purchased by the trustee in order to finance operations linked to exports.

6 The loan figures are adjusted for accounting movements, fundamentally caused by transfers of financial trusts, which although they affect the balances of this balance sheet item do not affect the stock of financing granted. In turn, in November there was a correction of the personal loans series, since a public entity incorporated the financing that until then was not reporting.

Base 1993 = 100 millions of $

In line with economic activity that, according to INDEC data, would be reaching the levels of late 2000 (see Graph 5.2), commercial loans continue showing a good growth pace, and in November they increased $420 million (2.7%). As happened in the two previous months, in the last month it was the operations related to documents that explains the largest proportion of the increase, which amounted to $230 million (3.6%), of which around 70% corresponded to discounted documents. This trend of greater growth in documents led by discounted documents is expected to continue and even intensify in the coming months, due to the regulatory changes implemented at the end of November aimed at eliminating the tariff for the discount of documents issued by companies whose credit quality makes a guarantee unnecessary⁷. For its part, overdrafts in current accounts showed growth of $110 million (1.8%) in the month, while the rest of the financing included in "other loans" increased approximately $80 million (2.5%).

Accompanying the good situation in the agricultural sector, which entails increasing sales of agricultural machinery, and the good performance of automobile sales, which since May have been at levels above the 2000 average, prendary loans showed an increase of $76 million (5.1%) in November, the largest since January 2000. In the case of mortgage loans, amortizations and prepayments continue exceeding the amounts of new financing, so a new decline is observed, on this occasion of only $27 million (-0.3%), which turns out to be the smallest since the crisis hit. Thus, just as had occurred in September, in November the greater growth of prendary loans, combined with the smaller decline in mortgages, implied a net increase in loans with real guarantees, which increased $49 million (0.5%).

Loans to the private sector in foreign currency acquired renewed dynamism during November, yielding growth of around US$45 million (3.3%) which is explained by the discount of documents associated with export financing, which grew US$69 million (8.6%), partially offset by slight declines in the rest of the lines.

According to the evolution of the MERVAL index, in November the quotations of variable income securities fell 5.8%, discontinuing the positive trend of previous months, although it continues accumulating a gain of 13% so far this year. The decline in prices was negatively influenced by news generated by the restructuring of national public debt, which offset the improvement in operational results of the third quarter of listed companies and the good performance of emerging markets (see Graph 6.2.1.1).

In particular, the participation of public securities issued by the National Government continued to be 62%. In absolute terms, this type of investment experienced growth of 1.2% compared to October, which was associated with growth of similar magnitude of non-guaranteed negotiable public securities, which constitute 90% of the total. Although the aggregate variation was of small magnitude, a substitution of bonds whose services are paid regularly was evidenced, especially Consolidation Bonds and BODEN in thousands of pesos, for securities eligible in the debt restructuring process currently underway.

Actions, considering both those issued by local joint-stock companies and by foreign companies, also maintained their participation in the total investment portfolio at 23%. Compared to the previous month, and despite the decrease in the prices of these securities in the local market, the AFJPs increased their holdings of this type of investment by 1.6% (see Graph 6.2.3.1.1).

The portion occupied by time deposits remained at 6%, while in absolute terms this type of investment showed a slight increase compared to the end of October, of $50 million (1.7%). This increase resulted from the increase in time deposits adjustable by CER, which amounted to $230 million, which was partially offset by the decrease in time deposits in non-adjustable pesos by CER, of $180 million (see Graph 6.2.3.1.2).

Likewise, although to a lesser extent, holdings in the rest of the types of funds also showed positive monthly variations.

 profitability of these funds, which went from 66.4% in October to
 12.3% annually in November. (see Chart 6.2.3.2.2).

 The assets of fixed income funds remained relatively stable
 during November, registering a slight decline of $7 million in
 relation to the previous month. This change in behavior by
 investors, who had been increasing their holdings in these funds
 at a rate on the order of 15% monthly, could be reflecting a certain
 cautious attitude assumed in the face of the postponement of the
 debt swap. As mentioned in Section 6.2.2, the announcement of
 this extension negatively affected the price of public securities,
 which had a negative impact on the returns of these funds, which
 went from 23% in October to 4.4% in November.
