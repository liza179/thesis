1. Summary

The monthly average balance of private deposits in pesos remained practically unchanged with respect to September in nominal terms, with an increase in sight deposits (2.7%) and a decline in time deposits (2.7%).

During October, and despite the foreign exchange controls in place, a significant increase in foreign currency demand by individuals was observed, which led to lower seasonally-adjusted growth of private M2 and for time deposits to show a downward trajectory. As of October 28, the regulatory change entered into force establishing a limit of US$200 monthly for access to the foreign exchange market by individuals.

In October, the monthly average of the Monetary Base (MB) was $1,386.4 billion, which implied an over-compliance of the target of $4.9 billion (0.4%). For November, the BCRA Monetary Policy Committee (COPOM) established an MB target growth of 2.5% with respect to the October target. In this way, the resulting MB target for the beginning of November is estimated at $1,584 billion, which will be adjusted by the net foreign exchange operations of the month.

The interest rate of the Liquidity Notes (LELIQ) fell 10.4 p.p. since the end of September, until reaching on October 11 the minimum rate of 68% annual that the COPOM had set on September 18. The rates paid for time deposits, while also following a downward trajectory, fell by less than half. For example, the TM20 of private banks averaged 55.7%, 6.1 p.p. below that observed in the previous month. For November, the COPOM decided to reduce the minimum LELIQ rate to 63% annual, consistent with market projections of deceleration in the inflation rate.

Foreign currency deposits of the private sector decelerated their rate of decline in October. The balance ended October at US$19,100 million, 10.6% below its level at the end of the previous month. In October, financial entities obtained funds from the collection of foreign currency loans to the private sector. As a consequence, banking liquidity in foreign currency increased with respect to September, averaging 54% of deposits in dollars, practically at the levels prior to the electoral period.

Loans in pesos to the private sector registered a seasonally-adjusted nominal increase, driven mainly by lines intended for commercial purposes and, to a lesser extent, by financing granted through credit cards.

Monetary Report | October 2019 | BCRA | 12. Monetary Aggregates

The monthly average balance of private deposits in pesos remained practically unchanged with respect to September in nominal terms, with an increase in sight deposits (2.7%) and a decline in time deposits (2.7%).

The significant increase in foreign currency demand by individuals and the transfer of investment fund (FCI) placements from remunerated sight deposits towards repos at the BCRA since mid-September led to seasonally-adjusted nominal private M2 growth being below what was observed in most of the previous months: it went from an average of 3.2% between April and September to 2.5% in October.1
The significant increase in foreign currency demand by individuals mentioned also affected the evolution of time deposits, especially those of smaller size, which declined during almost the entire month (see Graph 2.1). As of October 28, the trend changed with the entry into force of the regulatory change that established a limit of US$200 monthly for access to the foreign exchange market for natural persons.2 Ultimately, the monthly average balance of time deposits in pesos of the private sector decreased 2% in nominal and seasonally adjusted terms.

In October, the monthly average of the Monetary Base (MB) was $1,386.4 billion, which implied an overperformance of the target of $4.9 billion (0.4%). For November, the BCRA Monetary Policy Committee (COPOM) established a growth of the MB target of 2.5% with respect to the October target, in line with the BCRA's money demand projections, corrected for the effect of the recent reserve requirement change ($154 billion) to avoid excessive monetary contraction.3 In this way, the resulting MB target for the beginning of November is estimated at $1,584 billion, which will be adjusted for the month's net foreign exchange operations.4

1If the effect of FCI repos at the BCRA is excluded, the monthly nominal seasonally adjusted growth of private M2 is 5.3%.

3 The recent decision of the BCRA board to provide that the option of integrating part of the reserves with LELIQ be available only for time deposits will generate from November an increase of $154 billion in MB demand.

In the foreign currency deposit segment, deposits of the private sector significantly decelerated their decline. At the end of October, the balance of these deposits was US$19,100 million, 10.6% lower than that presented one month earlier.

## 3. Liquidity of financial entities

In October, most of the foreign currency deposit repayment came from the collection of loans to the private sector. As a consequence, foreign currency liquidity increased with respect to September, averaging 54% of dollar deposits (see Graph 3.1).

Graph 3.1 Graph 3.2

On the other hand, broad liquidity in pesos (which includes balances in current accounts at the BCRA, cash holdings of financial entities and LELIQ and repos) remained at elevated levels, averaging the month at 59.4% of deposits (see Graph 3.2).

## 4. Passive interest rates

The interest rate on Liquidity Letters (LELIQ) fell 10.4 p.p. from late September, until reaching on October 11 the minimum rate of 68% annually that the COPOM had set on September 18 (see Graph 4.1).

Monetary Report | October 2019 | BCRA | 3

The rates paid for time deposits also followed a downward trajectory. The TM20 – interest rate for time deposits of $20 million or more, 30 to 35 days maturity – of private banks averaged 55.7%, 6.1 p.p. below that observed in the previous month, while that paid for time deposits of up to $100 thousand and up to 35 days averaged 53.5%, 2.1 p.p. lower than that of the previous month.

For November, the COPOM decided to reduce the minimum LELIQ rate to 63% annually, consistent with market projections of deceleration in the inflation rate, in order to guarantee a positive return in real terms for savers.

## 5. Loans to the private sector and active interest rates
In October, loans in pesos to the private sector continued to accelerate, registering an increase of 4.0% average monthly without seasonality. The year-on-year rate of change also gained momentum, although it still remains at historically low levels (8.3%). The monthly dynamism of loans in pesos is explained mainly by the evolution of lines intended for commercial purposes and, to a lesser extent, by the growth of financing through credit cards.

Graph 5.1 Graph 5.2

Monetary Report | October 2019 | BCRA | 4 The nominal balance and balance adjusted for seasonality of advances registered an increase of 12.7% in the month, while that of documents grew 8.5%. The interest rates of the shorter-term lines declined, in a similar manner to what was observed for LELIQs. The document discount rate stood at 63.3%, declining on average 4.7 p.p., while the total advances rate averaged 76%, decreasing 8.7 p.p in the month. In contrast, the rate applied to single-signature documents averaged 67.7% showing an average monthly increase of 5.6 p.p. This result would be associated with a lower incidence in October of the refinancing of debt in dollars through loans in pesos, which had decreased the weighted average rate by amount in September.

Regarding lines intended for consumption, credit card financing registered an average monthly expansion of 5.7% without seasonality, which would be linked to the increase in consumption within the framework of AHORA 12 observed in recent months. Meanwhile, personal loans in nominal terms without seasonality contracted for the sixth consecutive month (1.2% monthly). The interest rate on personal loans averaged 75.6%, showing a monthly decrease of 1.1 p.p.

Regarding loans with real collateral, pledged loans presented a monthly decline of 2.3% in nominal terms and without seasonality, accumulating 14 consecutive months of contraction. For their part, mortgages grew 0.3% in the month. The interest rates on adjustable mortgage credits by UVA averaged 6.7% and showed an average monthly decline of 0.8 p.p. Meanwhile, the pledged rate adjusted by UVA showed a decline of 2 p.p. on average and stood at 12.6% in October.

In the foreign currency segment, the average monthly balance of loans to the private sector decreased 11.8% (US$1,700 million), accumulating a contraction of 21.1% compared to last August. This decline in dollar loans was concentrated in financing through single-signature documents.

6. International Reserves and Foreign Exchange Market

The balance of international reserves ended October at US$43,260 million, which implied a decline of US$5,443 million compared to the close of the previous month (see Graph 6.1). This decline was explained by the decrease in dollar current accounts of financial entities at the BCRA, payments of debt by the National Treasury, and sales of dollars by the Central Bank.

Graph 6.1 Graph 6.2

During October the nominal peso/US dollar exchange rate increased 3.8% and ended at 59.73. The multilateral real exchange rate also rose, ending the month at 128.1, remaining above the values it registered between mid-2016 and early 2018 (see Graph 6.2).
