# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information
 Communication N° 37913

 Monetary Situation (month of June)

 During June, monetary and financial variables presented, in general, favorable developments. Although there was
 a reduction in the growth rate of deposits, loans to the private sector stopped their continuous decline, international
 reserves of the financial system increased, and interest rates presented on average levels lower than those observed
 in May.

 Following the significant increase observed especially during the second half of May, deposits continued growing
 during June although at a slower pace. Private deposits increased on average 0.8% (620 million pesos) equivalent to
 an annualized growth of 10.2%. On this occasion, as had been happening throughout the year, the increase occurred
 fundamentally in fixed-term deposits in dollars. Thus, the dollarization of private deposits reached 64% and con-
 sidering fixed-term placements at 78%.

 In June, the average of international reserves of the financial system, measured as the sum of reserves in gold and
 foreign exchange in the BCRA and the integration of minimum liquidity requirements in the correspondent abroad,
 increased 600 million pesos compared to the average of May and reached a level of 32,500 million pesos. This
 behavior of international reserves was associated with the increase in the integration of minimum liquidity require-
 ments that accompanied the increase on average of deposits. It should be noted that regarding the different forms of
 integration, the most used continued to be reverse repos for the BCRA which represented 62% of the total integra-
 tion of liquidity requirements.

 For its part, monetary circulation decreased 0.8% during June. In this way, the sustained decline that this variable
 presents continued to be observed in seasonally adjusted terms since 1998. Likewise, the intra-month behavior was
 practically identical to that of previous years.

 Considering the average as of June 27, loans to the private sector presented practically no variations. This fact is
 encouraging if we take into account that throughout the year they had been showing a sustained decline. In general,
 in June, a smaller reduction of commercial loans and an acceleration in the growth of mortgages was observed.

 For its part, the public sector did not exert additional pressures on the financing of the local financial system.
 In June, loans granted to the public sector practically remained at the levels of May because the government used
 other financing instruments.

 Following the significant increase that they showed in May, interest rates decreased in June, placing themselves
 in general at the levels observed in mid-1999. This behavior was influenced by the liquidity existing in the market,
 the country risk, which had fallen during the fourth week of May, and during June remained relatively stable, the
 stability of international interest rates and, as mentioned before, the behavior of the public sector which did not
 demand domestic funds. The interest rates for fixed-term deposits of more than one million pesos at 30 days term
 were those that showed the largest declines, between 0.3 and 0.4 percentage points for operations in pesos and
 dollars respectively. The interest rates of the short-term loan market between financial entities were reduced by
 approximately one percentage point, with the differential between currencies practically null.

 Private Banks (data as of April 2000) (1)
The total assets of private banks registered a significant increase of 4.1% during April 2000. This was mainly due to the increase in the item "Other credit from financial intermediation" (14.8%), which grew due to the increase in the integration of liquidity requirements through greater holdings of deposit certificates abroad and secondly by the increase in forward purchases and sales.

Total loans fell $500 million (0.9%), basically due to the decline in loans to the non-financial private sector.

Total deposits of private banks rose $300 million (0.5%) in April 2000. The main cause was the increase in fixed-term deposits in foreign currency and deposits of public securities. As for other sources of funding, both negotiable obligations and external loan lines fell (7.8% and 6.0% respectively).

(1) In this analysis, the group of private banks does not include Banco Hipotecario S.A.

In April, private banks recorded profits of 2.1% (annualized) of net equity. Benefits were observed especially in the increase in interest income and the significant drop in administration expenses. On the other hand, profits from asset holdings and services fell when compared to those recorded in the first months of the year, which contributed to reducing April's profits compared to those months.

The quality of the credit portfolio of private banks deteriorated during April. The irregular portfolio in terms of financing rose 0.3 percentage points, increasing to 7.3%, while the irregular portfolio net of provisions in terms of financing went from 2.0% to 2.1%. For its part, credit risk, measured as the irregular portfolio net of provisions in terms of net equity, increased from 11.3% to 11.5%.

The total capital requirement of private banks registered a slight increase of $50 million (0.7%), explained by the increase in capital requirement for market risk. For its part, capital integration decreased $100 million (1.0%) due to the increase in deductible accounts. The increase in capital requirement and the decrease in integration caused a reduction in the excess of integration, which in terms of total capital requirement went from 36.3% to 34.0%. Likewise, capital integration in terms of risk-weighted assets according to Basel verified a slight decline (0.1 percentage points) and continued to maintain itself at a level (18.4%) much higher than that required by local regulation and internationally recommended.
