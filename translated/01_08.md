## Monetary Situation (July 2001)

After two months of positive evolution of the main monetary variables, in July a decline was observed in deposits, loans, and international reserves, and an increase in interest rates.

Total deposits, considering average figures, decreased $3,000 million (3.7%). Two-thirds of the decline was observed in private sector deposits, which showed a reduction of $2,300 million (3.1%), although if month-end balances are considered, the loss of private deposits reached $5,400 million (7.2%). Almost 80% of the decline in private sector deposits was a consequence of the behavior of time deposits, which began to fall from the first days of the month, intensifying their decrease from the second week onwards. Unlike what was observed in other similar periods, the decrease in time deposits was observed not only in deposits of amounts exceeding one million (it should be noted that, throughout July, Fixed-Term and Money Market Mutual Funds decreased their assets, combined, by $1,100 million), but also, although to a lesser extent, in those of amounts below that figure.

Given the liquidity problems that this situation generated in financial entities, the BCRA decided to use the instruments at its disposal. In that sense, it increased the stock of active repos (around $1,800 million throughout July) and modified the minimum cash and liquidity requirements regulations. In this case, in a first moment, the consideration of July and August positions together was established and then this measure was complemented with the reduction of one percentage point in the liquidity requirements demands for said two-month position, the computation of cash in transit in the integration of minimum cash, and the offsetting of positions in pesos and dollars up to a certain percentage.

Circulation in the hands of the public increased 0.4% compared to the average in June. However, if seasonally adjusted figures are considered (July tends to be a month with positive seasonality), a decline of around 2% occurred.

Associated with the behavior of deposits, a decline in loans granted by financial entities was also verified, especially those denominated in pesos.

For its part, international reserves of the financial system decreased on average $2,990 million (10.6%), although considering month-end balances the decline reached $6,650 million (23.4%), figures that reflect the decline in the quotation of public securities that make up the reserves.

Interest rates experienced significant increases, especially those corresponding to operations in pesos among financial entities, while those corresponding to operations in dollars showed relatively smoother movements, reflecting a significant increase in the differential between currencies. Interest rates for fixed-term deposits showed similar behavior although with smaller magnitudes.

## Private Banks (data as of May 2001)
The total assets of private banks decreased 1.3% during May 2001. The decline in the aforementioned item fundamentally reflects the negative effect of the line "Other credits from financial intermediation" (2.2%), which in turn captured the decline in loans received with repurchase agreement at term, loans granted with resale agreement at term and deposit certificates associated with the fulfillment of minimum liquidity requirements. On the other hand, the reduction in loans to the non-financial private sector (1.2%) also contributed to the fall in total assets. Additionally, the increase in holdings of private securities (73.6%) slightly cushioned the aforementioned effects. Finally, the net assets of accounting duplications generated by repo operations, at term and spot for settlement, registered a decrease of 0.9%.

Regarding alternative sources of funding, loan lines from abroad recorded an increase of 5.2%, while negotiable obligations decreased 14.0% mainly due to the operations of four major private banks. In May 2001, private banks recorded profits corresponding to 12.1% of net equity in annualized terms, thus obtaining the highest gain evidenced in the year. The main improvement compared to the previous month was observed in the significant increase in results from holding financial assets, which in turn rose particularly due to the effect of increased gains from holding public securities. However, the increase in accrued income tax slightly cushioned the previous effect. The high profitability of May contributed to the accumulated result of the second quarter exceeding by 1.1 p.p. of net equity the result of the first quarter of 2001. As a consequence, the profitability of 2001 accumulated through May reached a value of 8.2% of net equity in annualized terms.

The total capital requirement of private banks registered a decrease of 1.5% in May 2001, derived fundamentally from the decrease in capital requirement for credit and interest rate risk (1.5%), which in turn reflected the negative effect of the behavior of risk-weighted assets. In turn, the variation of the latter was due to the decline in total assets. On the other hand, total capital integration increased 0.9% due to the significant increase in complementary net equity (8.2%), which in turn was increased by the high results computed during May. The aforementioned changes caused the rise in the integration surplus, which in terms of total capital requirement went from 45.8% to 49.4%. Finally, total capital integration in terms of risk-weighted assets according to Basel increased 0.5 percentage points, placing itself at a level (20.7%) much higher than what is established by local regulation and by internationally recommended minimum requirements.
