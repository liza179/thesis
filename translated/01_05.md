# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information
 Communication No. 40.352

## Monetary Situation (April 2001)

Throughout April, total deposits remained virtually unchanged, although those corresponding to the private sector fell by around 1%. However, if the April average is considered, a decline in total deposits of approximately $2,700 million (3.3%) can be observed compared to the March average, almost entirely explained by the evolution of private sector placements. It should be noted that, since these are average figures, the magnitude of the decline was strongly influenced by the behavior of deposits during the second half of March.

To avoid the negative impact on the lending capacity of the financial system resulting from the deposit decline that began in March, the Central Bank implemented a reduction in the requirement of minimum liquidity requirements of 2 percentage points for the month of April. It also admitted as a computable concept for compliance, the holding of a bond for $2,000 million, maturing in 2002, which the national government placed on April 16. These measures had their counterpart in a decrease in the international reserves of the financial system, which fell US$3,300 million, considering the April average compared to that of March.

Interest rates, in general, remained at high levels throughout April, although not reaching the maximums observed in March. This behavior was influenced by the increase in sovereign risk, which averaged 1,000 basis points, and by the negative evolution of deposits. The interbank lending rate in pesos, which had experienced the greatest increase during March, fell on average more than 6 percentage points compared to the previous month, ending April at 11.3%. In this way the spread between currencies decreased, from 12 percentage points in March to 6 percentage points in April. For their part, interest rates on deposits of more than one million (pesos or dollars), which had increased during the second half of March, maintained those levels throughout April.

## Private Banks (data as of February 2001)

During February 2001, the total assets of the group of private banks increased 2.6%, which was due, in the first place, to the increase of 4.5% in the item "Other credits from financial intermediation," which in turn increased due to the effect of the increase in spot purchase and sale operations to be settled, and by the increase in repurchase agreements to meet minimum liquidity requirements. Second, the increase of 15.9% in the holding of government securities, especially those acquired through repurchase operations, also contributed to the increase in total assets. This increase was partially offset by the decline in loans to the financial sector, which registered a decrease of 11.8%. If net assets are considered excluding accounting duplications generated by repurchase operations, forward operations and spot operations to be settled, it is observed that they registered a decrease of 0.1%.

Regarding alternative sources of funding, negotiable obligations registered an increase of 3.0%, while loan lines from abroad decreased 3.4%.

In February 2001, private banks recorded profits equivalent to 10.0% of net equity on an annualized basis, thus continuing the growing trend observed since November 2000. The positive variation in profitability compared to the previous month was mainly due to decreases in accrued income tax, charges for bad debts, and administration expenses, effects partially offset by declines in results from the holding of financial assets and from interest income.
The total capital requirement of private banks registered a decline of 1.4% in February 2001, explained fundamentally by the decrease in the capital requirement for credit risk (1.5%), which in turn reflects the negative effect of the behavior of risk-weighted assets. On the other hand, total capital integration increased 0.7% due to the increase in basic net equity. The variations in total requirement and total capital integration caused an increase in the integration surplus, which in terms of total capital requirement went from 48.4% to 51.6%. Finally, total capital integration in terms of risk-weighted assets according to Basel rose 0.5 percentage points, placing itself at a level (20.5%) much higher than that established by local regulation and by internationally recommended minimum requirements.
