Monetary Report | January 2015 | BCRA | 2

1. Summary
• In January, the broadest monetary aggregate in pesos (M3) showed a monthly growth of 5%, while in year-over-year terms the increase stood at 27.5%. As is seasonally expected, a deceleration was verified in the monthly growth of transactional money demand and an acceleration of fixed-term placements, both from the public sector and the private sector.

• Private sector fixed-term deposits increased 3.1% in the month. In particular, retail deposits recorded a monthly variation of 4.6%, associated with the boost being provided by the scheme of minimum interest rates established by the BCRA since October 2014. In this way, retail deposits accelerated their year-over-year variation, reaching 35.4%, a growth that is 12.3 p.p. higher than that registered by wholesale fixed-term deposits.

• Loans in pesos to the private sector presented a growth of 2.5% ($13,680 million), which was lower than in December, as expected during the summer recess period. In year-over-year terms, they continued showing a rate of variation of around 20%. Among the different credit lines, the increase in overdrafts on current accounts and financing with credit cards stood out.

• The liquidity in domestic currency of financial entities (sum of cash in banks, the balances in current accounts of entities at the Central Bank, net repos with such entity and holdings of LEBAC) increased in January, and in terms of the total deposits in pesos it represented 40.2%. The monthly increase of 0.6 p.p. was explained by the rise in net repos and LEBAC holdings, and was concentrated fundamentally in some public banks. On the other hand, a reduction was observed both in the proportion maintained in cash, due to the seasonal decline in money demand, and in that maintained in the current account at the Central Bank. Regarding this, the possibility that entities have of computing on a quarterly basis (December 2014-February 2015) the minimum cash position to manage their liquidity during the quarter, allowed them to reduce the average integration of January, following the surplus registered in December.

• In a context of exchange rate stability and ample liquidity levels of the financial system, slight declines occurred in the interest rates of the LEBAC that the BCRA auctions weekly. The decrease was between 0.2 p.p. and 0.6 p.p. in the shorter-term instruments that are placed at a predetermined cut-off rate –at terms of 100 days and 120 days–, which stood at 26.56% and 27.24%, respectively; while the reduction was 0.3 p.p. in the instrument awarded with longer maturity, at 360 days term, which stood at 28.94%.

• International reserves reached US$31,451 million at the end of January, remaining at a stable level compared to December. During the month, two additional tranches of the local currency swap agreement with the Central Bank of the People's Republic of China were activated. Within the framework of this agreement, the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic is enabled to request exchanges for up to a maximum equivalent to approximately US$11 billion in total, which constitutes support for the execution of financial, exchange rate and monetary policy.

The monetary base reached an average monthly balance of $453,980 million, 2.5% higher than December. In year-over-year terms, growth was 23.3% (see Graph 2.3). Among its components, all the increase corresponded to cash in circulation, as bank reserves (composed in turn by cash in banks and balances deposited in current accounts at the BCRA) were reduced, once the greater cash needs of banks typical of year-end were overcome, and given the possibility offered by the quarterly position for compliance with the minimum cash requirement (see Section 3. Liquidity of Financial Entities). Among the factors that drove the average monthly growth of the monetary base were

The liquidity in domestic currency of financial entities (sum of cash in banks, balances in current accounts of entities at the Central Bank, net repos with such entity and LEBAC holdings) increased in January, and in terms of the total deposits in pesos represented 40.2% (see Chart 3.1). The monthly increase of 0.6 p.p. was explained by the rise in excess liquidity (net repos and LEBAC holdings) and was concentrated fundamentally in some public banks. Meanwhile, a reduction was observed both in the proportion maintained in cash, due to the seasonal decline in demand for transactional money, and in that maintained in the current account at the Central Bank. Regarding this, the possibility that the quarterly calculation (December 2014-February 2015) of the minimum cash position gives entities to manage their liquidity during the quarter allowed them to reduce the average integration of January, following the excess recorded in December. In this way, the estimated excess in the quarterly position stood, at the end of January, at 0.3% of deposits in pesos (see Chart 3.2).

For its part, the liquidity ratio of the foreign currency segment remained stable (increasing only 0.2 p.p. with respect to December), standing at 108.4% of the total dollar deposits for the January average.

¹⁴ Monthly variations in loans are adjusted for accounting movements, fundamentally caused by transfers of loans in the portfolio of entities to financial trusts. In the present report, "amounts granted" or "new loans" are understood as loans (new and renewals) arranged in a period. In contrast, the variation in the balance consists of loans arranged, minus the amortizations and cancellations of the period.

...les, continued showing a rate of variation on the order of 20% (see Graph 4.1). Among the different credit lines, the increase in current account advances and financing with credit cards stood out (see Graph 4.2).

In effect, among commercial lines, current account advances accelerated their rate of expansion, evidencing an increase of 6% ($4,040 million), which was placed among the highest since mid-2012 and exceeded the growth observed in January of the previous year. Thus, the year-on-year rate of variation of these loans increased 3.3 p.p., reaching 21.2% (see Graph 4.3). When observing the daily evolution of this line, it is verified that throughout January it presented a trajectory similar to that of other years and the large average increase was fundamentally due to statistical carryover (see Graph 4.4). For its part, financing instruments through documents remained practically stable throughout the month, once the period of greater liquidity demand by companies concluded. In effect, they registered an increase of 0.2% ($300 million), and over the last 12 months accumulated growth of 18.3%.

It is worth mentioning that in the first half of the year the sixth stage of the Credit Line for Productive Investment (LCIP)⁵ will be developed. The financial entities covered by the regulation will allocate to this line, at minimum, an amount equivalent to 6.5% of deposits in pesos from the non-financial private sector of November 2014⁶. This new allocation quota, which amounts to approximately $37,400 million, must be assigned in its entirety to financing of SMEs, at a maximum rate of 19% and a minimum term of 36 months.

Furthermore, a special mechanism was implemented aimed both at privileging financing for smaller companies within SMEs and at promoting credit regionalization, so that financing can reach with greater incentives the regions with lower economic development. Also, on this occasion the possibility was established to allocate up to 20% of the quota to financing working capital associated with investment projects.

Regarding loans aimed at financing mainly household consumption, financing with credit cards continued growing at a good pace, exhibiting an increase of 6.4% ($7,100 million), the highest of recent years for the period. Thus, its year-on-year variation increased 0.4 p.p. to reach 37.7%. For its part, personal loans grew 1.7% ($2,000 million) and softened their monthly expansion rate; as is usual in January, given that the collection of the mid-year bonus typically motivates a decline in demand for new personal loans,

of single-signature documents, to reach 24.6%.
In this case, it should be noted that upon completion of one stage of the LCIP, the participation of these credits, which are usually granted at lower interest rates than the rest and with longer terms, tends to decrease. This contributes to the increase in the weighted average interest rate (see Chart 5.10). In contrast, the interest rate applied to document discounts decreased 0.6 p.p. in the month, averaging 24.6%, reaching its lowest level in 13 months.

The interest rates of the longer-term lines showed increases, led by those applied to loans with real guarantees. In particular, the monthly average of the interest rate for mortgage loans to individuals was 24.6%, 0.6 p.p. above the December level, while in

12 In June, Communication "A" 5590 came into effect, which set maximum interest rates, essentially for personal loans
and secured loans for motor vehicles to individuals, calculated based on LEBAC yields and which are published
monthly by the Central Bank.
13 For the establishment of maximum levels for personal and secured loan rates, entities were divided into two groups. Group I
is composed of those entities that concentrate 1% or more of private sector deposits, while Group II comprises the remaining
entities.

 20.0

  Fixed Income The patrimony of the ICFs, denominated both in pesos
 15.0 Money Market and in foreign currency, ended the first month of the
  Mixed Income year with growth of $8,280 million (6.3%), placing
  Variable Income 10.0 Total itself at the close of January at $140,560 million (see
 5.0 Chart 7.1).

 0.0 The monthly increase was driven fundamentally by

 -5.0 funds that are usually used for liquidity management, due
 to their reduced volatility and settlement period of the
 -10.0 share units, which more than reversed the decline they
 Jan-11 Jul-11 Jan-12 Jul-12 Jan-13 Jul-13 Jan-14 Jul-14 Jan-15 had presented during December. In effect, the patrimony
Source: CAFCI and BCRA in fixed income funds grew almost $6,000 million (9.1%),
 thus exceeding $71,000 million, with $4,000 million of
 the increase corresponding to short-term funds, which
 replicate the BADLAR return of private banks. This in-
 crease occurred fundamentally due to the subscription of
 Chart 7.2 new share units and, to a lesser extent, by the evolution

Variable rate (barely -0.1%), remaining at US$298 million.
On this occasion, the slight increase in mixed income funds
(US$3.3 million) almost offset the decline in fixed income
and variable income funds.

## Financial Trusts14

In January, the issuance of financial trusts (FF)
totaled around $1,000 million, showing a
marked decrease compared to previous months, in
line with the behavior of previous years. This phe-
nomenon is due to the lower number of operations (only
8 in the month), something that is usually recorded during the summer recess (see Chart 7.2).

When discriminating the amount placed in the month by type of
trustor, a decrease in the volume of securitized assets is observed in all cases. "Mutualities, cooperatives, non-banking credit card issuers
and other financial services providers" placed
slightly more than $400 million, a 32% decrease from
December. In addition to loans linked to consumption, among the assets securitized by said trustors
were pledge credits. For its part, retail
stores and financial entities issued
approximately $300 million and $170 million, respectively, which in both cases meant a decline of around
70% in relation to the previous month. Finally,
a placement by a company from the agricultural sector
was registered, which was backed by commercial credits.

The cutoff interest rate (amount-weighted average) of senior
titles -in pesos and with duration of
less than 14 months- with variable yield decreased 0.5
p.p. and stood at 26.2%. Meanwhile, no
fixed-rate operations were registered (see Chart 7.3).

## 8. Main Policy Measures by
Other Central Banks

During January, most of the monetary policy
decisions adopted by the main central
banks were marked by the effects on inflation of the fall in oil prices and by the
capital movements that this induced, either directly
or indirectly.

In a context of stagnation in the level of activity
and increasing deflation, linked in part to the fall
in oil prices (see Chart 8.1), the Governing
Council (GC) of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided
in its January meeting to implement a program of
large-scale asset purchases (quantitative easing -
QE) for the first time in the history of the ECB. Specifically,
the ECB implemented a program to purchase public
and private titles of €60,000 million monthly
until -at least- September 2016, or until the
inflation trajectory is consistent with a
convergence to the ECB's target15. Of the total program,

For its part, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) managed to reduce exchange rate volatility after having increased the Key Rate—the interest rate for one-week liquidity absorption and provision auctions—by 7.5 p.p. during December. This allowed the CBR to reduce the Key Rate to 15% at the end of January.

Among the countries in the region, on January 15, the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to reduce by 0.25% the target for the interbank market interest rate, which moved to 3.25% (see Graph 8.5). This measure was motivated by a context of economic growth below potential and inflation that, while it is above the target range (2% ± 1 p.p.), would tend to decrease due to the fall in oil prices. Additionally, it reduced again, from 9.5% to 9%, the reserve requirement ratio in domestic currency, with the objective of promoting lending in soles.

Finally, in a context with weak activity levels and inflation slightly below the upper limit of the target range (4.5% ± 2 p.p.), on January 21 the Monetary Policy Committee (COPOM) of the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) decided to increase the target for the Selic rate by 0.5 p.p., to 12.25%, in line with market expectations. Although the press release was very brief, giving no signals about what the next decision on March 4 would be, most analysts expect a new Selic increase of 0.25 p.p. (see Graph 8.6).
