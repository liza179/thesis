Monetary Report | December 2014 | BCRA | 2 1. Summary
• In December, the broadest monetary aggregate in pesos (M3) grew 5.1%, ending the year with an
interannual expansion rate around 24%. In a month characterized by high demand for transactional
money, currency in circulation held by the public and sight deposits from the private sector concentrated
the largest part of the M3 increase. This behavior is explained by seasonal factors, such as the payment of
the half-year bonus, higher family spending during the holiday period and the beginning of summer
recess.

• These seasonal factors are consistent with a deceleration in the monthly growth of time deposits
in pesos from the private sector. Nevertheless, on this occasion the monthly increase of 1.1% meant an
acceleration of its interannual variation rate to 28%. In the last quarter of the year, retail time placements
stood out, favored by the minimum interest rate scheme for individuals established by the BCRA from
early October onwards. Thus, both in November and December the segment of time placements of less
than $1 million was the one that grew the most and ended the year with an increase of 32% year-on-year,
above that recorded by time deposits of $1 million and more (24% year-on-year).

• Loans in pesos to the private sector accelerated their monthly expansion rate, exhibiting an
increase of 3.1% ($16,535 million) and an interannual variation in the order of 20%. The greater
dynamism presented by loans was linked to seasonal factors – reflected in the performance of mostly
commercial loans and credit card financing – as well as policies aimed at promoting credit to the productive
sector. With respect to commercial lines, financing granted through advances and discounted documents
grew encouraged by seasonal factors, while single-signature documents were favored by financing granted
under the Productive Investment Credit Line (LCIP), on the occasion of the closing of the second tranche
of 2014.

• The higher seasonal demand for transactional money was also reflected in the composition of
the liquidity of financial entities, which increased the proportion they maintain of cash and current
account deposits at the Central Bank in relation to total deposits. These assets explained the increase of
0.4 percentage points in the liquidity of the segment in domestic currency of financial entities (sum of
cash in banks, the current account of entities at the Central Bank, net repurchase agreements with such
entity and LEBAC holdings), which in December averaged 39.6% of total deposits in pesos.

• With respect to interest rates, both those paid in the segment of retail time deposits and those
corresponding to wholesale placements remained relatively stable compared to the previous month.
Meanwhile, the interest rates applied to loans to the private sector, in general, increased although in a
limited manner. Such is the case of the average interest rate on document discounts, which was located
at 25.3%, 0.4 percentage points above the previous month, while that applied to single-signature documents
was located at 24.2%, also increasing 0.4 percentage points.

• International reserves totaled US$31,443 million at the end of December, which represented a
monthly growth of US$2,532 million. Among the factors that explained the monthly increase in
international reserves, the net purchases of foreign currency by the Central Bank stood out, totaling
US$948 million. On the other hand, the third tranche of the currency swap agreement with the Central
Bank of the People's Republic of China was activated. It should be recalled that, within the framework of
this agreement, the BCRA can request additional exchanges for up to a maximum close to US$11 billion in
in total, which represents support in the execution of financial, exchange rate and monetary policy.

# MONETARY REPORT | DECEMBER 2014 | BCRA | 4

The monetary base reached an average monthly balance of $442,860 million, showing a monthly growth of 8.6%, in a manner consistent with the seasonal increase of broader monetary aggregates. In year-on-year terms, the year ended with an expansion close to 22%, one of the lowest levels in recent years (see Chart 2.3). The monthly increase was composed of both currency in circulation held by the public and banking reserves (comprised of cash in financial entities and the balances of current accounts of financial entities at the BCRA).

In compliance with what is established in Article 42 of the Organic Charter, at the end of December the BCRA presented its objectives and plans regarding the development of monetary, financial, credit and exchange rate policies for the year 20154.

With respect to monetary policy, during 2015 the BCRA will manage liquidity in accordance with the economy's needs. The sterilization of excess or deficiency of liquidity will be carried out through the various available instruments: operations with Central Bank Bills and Notes, repo agreements, and modification of reserve requirements.

Furthermore, particular attention will be paid to encouraging the participation of small savers in the peso segment of the local financial system. In general terms, the BCRA will continue promoting savings and greater financial inclusion of the population. Through financial education and the expansion of rights to citizens, the aim will be to bring the BCRA closer to the community, especially in economically marginalized places, to generate a better banking and financial system that contributes to growth with social inclusion.

In terms of exchange rate policy, the managed floating exchange rate regime will be maintained. In this way, the BCRA will continue intervening in the foreign exchange market to reduce excessive volatility and avoid its adverse effects in terms of monetary, financial, and economic activity.

Maintaining the long-term objective of increasing credit depth, it is expected to continue with policies promoting productive financing at medium and long term, focusing on smaller-sized companies, increasing the volume and reducing the cost of credit for them. At the same time, the BCRA will seek to ensure that the least served segments of the population have access to credit under favorable conditions, limiting the cost of financing for families.

Finally, it should be noted that the BCRA's prudential regulations will continue to be oriented toward financial stability. The BCRA's Superintendency of Financial and Foreign Exchange Entities will continue during 2015 with the comprehensive supervision tasks of banks, financial companies, exchange houses and brokers deployed in the last quarter of the year with the objective of ensuring strict compliance with financial and foreign exchange regulations.

**Graph 5.4**

At the end of the month, the nominal balance in circulation of LEBAC was located at $261,457 million. The balance increased 2% compared to the end of November and continues to be composed exclusively of fixed-rate securities (LEBAC). The average monthly balance of LEBAC was equivalent to approximately 31% of the total deposits in pesos in December (see Graph 5.2).

The adjudicated amount of LEBAC reached $55,056 million. Within LEBAC in pesos, although most of it continued to be placed at terms between 90 and 180 days (49% of the total), an increase in the adjudicated amount stood out at longer terms, between 181 and 270 days, which reached 22% of the total (see Graph 5.3).

9 In this section the figures correspond to end-of-month data, except where otherwise specified.

Monetary Report | December 2014 | BCRA | 9 Regarding the main holders, the increase in the monthly balance was driven by financial entities, fundamentally public ones. Meanwhile, investment funds (FCI) and the rest of the holders registered declines (see Graph 5.4).

**Graph 5.5**

Regarding the foreign currency segment, the LEBAC balance was reduced by almost US$9 million, ending the month at US$668 million.

**Central Bank Repurchase Agreement Operations¹**

In December, the interest rates of passive repurchase agreements for the Central Bank remained at 13% and 14% for the terms of 1 and 7 days, respectively. In the case of active repurchase agreements, they remained at 16% and 17% for the same terms.

In particular, the balance of passive repurchase agreements for the Central Bank —in all the modalities in which the institution participates— decreased on average $3,000 million and was located at $15,300 million (see Graph 5.5).

**Graph 5.6**

**Interfinancial Markets¹**

In December, the interest rates of the interfinancial market increased slightly, registering intramonthly volatility lower than that observed in previous months. The average interest rate of operations at 1 business day in the call market increased 1.8 p.p., being located at 21.7%. Likewise, the average interest rate of operations at 1 business day among financial entities in the REPO round increased 1.6 p.p., placing itself at 22.1% (see Graph 5.6).
# Translation to English

The average daily amount traded in the interfinancial market (including the REPO round between entities and the call market) was around $6,000 million, approximately $380 million lower than the amount recorded in the previous month, although it remained at historically elevated levels.

**Interest Rates on Fixed-Term Deposits in Pesos for 30-35 days**

%; TNA Passive Interest Rates¹

In December, the interest rates paid by financial entities for their fixed-term deposits in pesos remained relatively stable.

In the retail segment, the monthly average of the interest rate paid by private entities for fixed-term deposits of up to $100 thousand and up to 35 days maturity remained virtually unchanged, standing at 23.2% (Graph 5.7). In this regard, it is worth noting that the interest rates in the retail segment are subject to regulations that establish minimum levels for the interest rates that entities must pay to individuals for their fixed-term deposits of up to $350 thousand. Indeed, the minimum interest rates, which stood at 23.4%, 23.9% and 25% for deposits with maturities of up to 44 days, 45 to 59 days and more than 60 days respectively, remained stable between November and December. In January, the minimum interest rates will be at these same levels, in line with the evolution of LEBAC interest rates in November.

With respect to the wholesale segment, the BADLAR for private banks –the interest rate for fixed-term deposits of $1 million and more, with 30-35 days maturity– averaged 20%. In this way, and as a consequence of the establishment of minimum interest rates for placements to individuals, in December the interest rate paid to wholesale depositors remained more than 3 p.p. below that received by families.

**Graph 5.8**
**Interest Rates on Current Account Advances**
**TNA, % (monthly average)**

In general, the interest rates applied to loans to the private sector increased slightly throughout December.

In particular, the monthly average of the interest rate for current account advances stood at 30.9%, remaining practically unchanged. Meanwhile, within this line, the interest rate for advances to companies of more than $10 million and up to 7 days maturity, averaged 24.3%, increasing by 1.3 p.p. It should be mentioned that part of the increase in the interest rate on advances responds to the greater need for seasonal liquidity by companies in the month of December (see Graph 5.8).

7. Collective Investment Instruments

Mutual Investment Funds

In December the net worth of the FCI, denominated
both in pesos and in foreign currency, was reduced
by $3,060 million (2.3%), placing itself at the end of the month
at $132,000 million (see Chart 7.1).
The monthly decline was driven fundamentally by the funds that are usually utilized for liquidity management given their reduced volatility and share redemption timeline. In effect, the equity in short-term fixed income funds, whose objective is to replicate the evolution of the BADLAR rate of private banks, fell some $1,600 million (2.4%), positioning itself at $65,000 million and that of Money Market funds decreased $1,200 million (3.3%), reaching $35,000 million. In both cases the behavior was produced fundamentally by the redemption of shares toward the second half of the month. Meanwhile, while the equity of variable income funds fell $600 million (13.2%) to $4,000 million, mixed income funds were the only ones that registered an increase during the month ($500 million to $25,000 million, 2.1%), due to greater subscription of shares.

With respect to returns in December, the estimated return of variable income funds was negative (-11.9% in the month) for the third consecutive month. Meanwhile, the other funds had positive results: the returns of fixed income and Money Market funds were positioned at 1.3% and the monthly return of mixed income funds ended at 0.5%.

With respect to the foreign currency segment, the equity of the FCIs was reduced US$18 million to US$298 million. The decline was driven mainly by fixed income funds, which fell US$15 million.

## Financial Trusts

In December, the second auction with public offering of Fiduciary Debt Securities (VDF) was conducted within the framework of the Argentine Credit Program of the Bicentenary for Single Family Housing (PRO.CRE.AR), which has the objective of improving and facilitating access to housing for low and middle socioeconomic sectors of the population. On this occasion, the National State placed VDF for $14,000 million, which are added to the $15,500 million that it had issued in October 2013 and that will be applied to the comprehensive development of urban and real estate projects as well as also to the granting of mortgage credits for the acquisition and construction of housing. The securities have an incremental fixed TNA, ranging from 10.5% to 17.5% at maturity and have an approximate duration of 5.4 years.

Excluding this important placement by the public sector, the emissions of financial trusts (FF) totaled $2,375 million, which meant an increase of almost 60% compared to the previous month. This increase was...
0 0 vo explained by the securitization of assets associated with consumer credit, in line with the greater purchases typical of year-end. In the same sense, the number of operations increased significantly, registering 26 issuances, the highest number of placements for the year (see Graph 7.2). Among the securitizers, this month retail businesses stood out, which placed $985 million, a historically elevated amount. For their part, financial entities and "Mutuals, cooperatives, non-banking issuers of credit card and other financial service providers" also showed an increase in the volume of securitized assets, placing in both cases around $600 million. The remainder corresponded to companies linked to the agricultural sector, which securitized commercial credits.

For its part, the cut-off interest rate (weighted average by amount) of senior titles –in pesos and with duration less than 14 months– with variable yield continued to increase and stood at 26.8%. Meanwhile, in the fixed-rate segment a single operation was recorded, whose cut-off rate was 23% (see Graph 7.3).

## 8. Main Policy Measures of Other Central Banks

During this period there were announcements and press statements with a strong impact on the markets by central banks of developed countries, while some monetary authorities of emerging countries modified their reference interest rates or reserve requirement coefficients, with the cases of Russia and Brazil standing out.

Among developed countries, in the particular case of the USA there was great expectation regarding whether in the meeting of December 18 the Federal Reserve's (FED) Open Market Committee (FOMC) would modify its commitment to maintain the objective of the federal funds rate (FFR) at current levels for a "considerable time," given that while the latest local macroeconomic indicators were favorable (see Graphs 8.1 and 8.2), the international context was adverse. The phrase "considerable time" was considered as an indirect indicator of when the FOMC could begin to raise the objective regarding FFR, being estimated to refer to a period of no less than 6 months. Finally, the communiqué released in the meeting of December 18 gave a signal that the increase in the FFR would probably occur in mid-2015, but at the same time reserving greater degrees of flexibility.

For its part, in an unscheduled meeting on December
1.23 18, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) joined the list of
central banks that remunerate deposits at a negative
interest rate.15 In this sense, it decided to introduce

be -0.25%, applied to deposits exceeding 10 million
1.21 Swiss francs, and will come into effect on January 22.

Chart 8.6 Among emerging countries, the Monetary Policy Committee (COPOM) of the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) increased the target for the Selic rate by 0.5 p.p. to 11.75%. This decision was made in a context where the majority of activity indicators continue to be discouraging, while inflation remained stable in recent months around 6.5% y.o.y. (see Chart 8.5).

40 Finally, various factors led the authorities of the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) to take emergency measures. First, it should be recalled that since the beginning of the conflict in Crimea, at the beginning of the year, a strong capital outflow was triggered – and consequent loss of value of the local currency – which was exacerbated from August, following the imposition of sanctions by the United States and the Eurozone. Second, during the second half of the year the international oil price fell markedly, standing at around US$60 per barrel in December, from near US$115 in June.

In this regard, it should be noted that oil and gas represent approximately 75% of Russian exports and half of the government's fiscal revenues. All this generated a loss of confidence in the local currency, which throughout the year depreciated approximately 85% (see Chart 8.6). The aggravation of these factors in recent weeks led the monetary authority to harden the contractionary bias of its monetary policy and increase its interest rates. In fact, the CBR met on December 11, when it increased by 1 p.p. its monetary policy interest rate (the key rate) to 10.5%. Then, in an unscheduled meeting on December 16, it decided to increase the key rate by 6.5 p.p. to 17% (see Chart 8.7). All this in a context of accelerating inflation and where the outlook for economic activity continues to deteriorate. For the coming year, a GDP contraction greater than 4% is expected.

16 On January 15, outside the analysis period of this report, the SNB decided to eliminate said minimum exchange rate and reduce again the interest rate for sight deposits at the SNB from -0.25% to -0.75%, and the target range of the 3-month Swiss Libor rate to between -0.25% and -1.25%.
