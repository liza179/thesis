1. Summary

In August, the monthly average balance of peso deposits from the private sector increased 1% in nominal terms, with growth of 1.6% in demand deposits and 0.5% in fixed-term deposits.

Natural persons continued renewing their fixed-term deposits in pesos during the month and their average balance remained stable. Legal entities, fundamentally Investment Funds, decreased their fixed-term deposits by 9% after August 9 and transferred them to demand deposits.

The bimonthly average (July-August) of the monetary base reached $1,347.1 billion. Following the dollar sales carried out by the BCRA in the month, the original MB target ($1,343.2 billion) was adjusted to $1,328 billion. Thus, the bimonthly average balance of the MB was positioned 0.3% above the original target and 1.4% above the adjusted target.

The interest rate on LELIQ placements increased with the rise in financial volatility. It completed a monthly increase of 22.9 percentage points to reach 83.3% annually at the end of August. The interest rates paid on fixed-term deposits accompanied this increase. For example, the TM 20 of private banks ended the month at 61.9%, 10.3 percentage points above its level at the end of July.

The monthly average balance of dollar deposits from the private sector in August decreased by 3.2%.

The behavior of dollar deposits was heterogeneous throughout the month; dollar deposits from the private sector grew until August 9 and began to decline as of August 12. At the end of the month they stood at US$26,600 million, 17% below the level they had at the end of July.

In August, the nominal and seasonally adjusted balance of peso loans to the private sector grew 1.6%, driven by credit card financing and advances. The balance of dollar loans to the private sector ended the month at US$15,430 million, registering a decrease of US$824 million with respect to July 31.

The statistical closing of this report was on September 5, 2019.

Monetary Report | August 2019 | BCRA | 2. Monetary Aggregates

In August, the monthly average balance of peso deposits from the private sector increased 1% in nominal terms, with an increase of 1.6% in demand deposits and 0.5% ($6,700 million) in fixed-term placements.

Chart 2.1
Fixed-term deposits in pesos of natural persons The behavior of peso placements from the private sector was not homogeneous among types of
thousands of estimated daily balance depositors. Natural persons continued renewing all
millions of $ August 9 of their maturities and the balance of their fixed-
800 term placements remained relatively stable (See
750 Chart 2.1).

700 In contrast, legal entities, mainly Investment
650 Funds (FCI), reduced their fixed-term deposit
600 balances by 9% after August 9 and transferred
550 them to demand deposits, which grew 4.4% in
500 nominal and seasonally adjusted terms (a fall of

A way to appreciate this transfer of funds between demand and fixed-term placements of legal entities is through the trajectory of placements of $20 million and more; the amount bracket where their deposits are concentrated (Chart 2.2). It should be noted that the decrease in fixed-term

fixed income was much more moderate than the redemptions of fixed income FCI, because these investors
allocate the majority of their portfolio to short-term public debt securities and a smaller portion
to deposits (see Chart 2.3.).

For its part, currency in circulation held by the public decreased 3.5% in real and seasonally adjusted
terms, as it grew 1.2% nominal seasonally adjusted. In short, with respect to July, both private
M2 and private M3 decreased in real and seasonally adjusted terms, 1.6% and 2.8%,
respectively.

In this environment, financial entities adopted a precautionary stance and maintained their
balances of current accounts in pesos at the BCRA above what is required by the Minimum Cash
regime. Thus, they concluded the bimonthly measurement period of reserve requirements in pesos with a surplus
equivalent to 0.5% of deposits in pesos, notably higher than what is
usually observed, around 0.2% of deposits (see Chart 2.3).

The average monthly balance of the Monetary Base (MB) was located at $1,312.7 billion and the bi-
monthly average (July – August) reached $1,347.1 billion. Following the dollar sales carried out
by the BCRA in the month, the original MB target ($1,343.2 billion) was adjusted to $1,328 billion.
Thus, the bimonthly average balance of the monetary base was located 0.3% above the original target
and 1.4% above the adjusted target (see Chart 2.4).3 It should be noted that, having increased
their voluntary reserve requirements as a precautionary measure, monetary conditions became more strict,
since money remained immobilized in the banks. This is a transitory increase in
MB demand, not an expansion due to greater supply.

The behavior of dollar deposits was heterogeneous throughout the month; dollar deposits
of the private sector grew until August 9 and began to decline starting August 12. The balance of dollar deposits of the private sector decreased 3.2% on average
monthly and at the end of the month was located at US$26,600 million, 17% below the level that it
presented at the end of July.

## 3. Liquidity of financial entities

In August, the liquidity in dollars of financial entities was equivalent to 54.8% of deposits
in foreign currency and was composed of deposits in current accounts at the BCRA
equivalent to 42.9% of deposits and by a cash balance that reached 12% of deposits.

(see Graph 3.1). After the deposit outflow, at the end of August broad liquidity continued to be positioned at similar levels in relation to the balance of dollar placements, with a slight increase in the participation of cash, to guarantee provision in the different bank branches.

In the peso segment, broad liquidity also remained at elevated levels, which includes balances in current accounts at the BCRA, cash holdings of financial entities and LELIQ and repos, was positioned at 63.7% of peso deposits.

## 3. Passive Interest Rates

In the current monetary scheme, the LELIQ interest rate is determined endogenously in daily auctions. From mid-August onwards, within the framework of an increase in financial volatility, the reference rate increased 22.9 p.p. until reaching 83.3% annually at the end of the month.

 The interest rates paid on fixed-term de- Graph 3.1

**TNA; % Active Interest Rates** Among the lines intended for consumption, credit card financing increased 5.6% in the month (nominal and adjusted for seasonality), favored by the increase in the second half of July, which left a positive "statistical carryover." Thus, in the last 12 months they accumulated growth of 22%. Meanwhile, personal loans declined 1% in August. The interest rate of loans in this line averaged 68.9%, showing an increase of 3 percentage points.

Regarding loans with real guarantee, pawned loans exhibited in August a decrease of 0.7% in nominal terms and without seasonality, a variation similar to that of July. The rate of pawned loans adjustable by UVA remained stable and averaged 15.4% in August. Meanwhile, mortgage loans maintained their monthly expansion rate of 0.5% monthly (in nominal terms and adjusted for seasonality). The interest rate of mortgage credits adjustable by UVA averaged 6.4%.

In real terms and adjusted for seasonality, loans in pesos to the private sector continued showing a downward trend, registering a decline of 3.2% monthly.

The international reserves balance ended August at US$54,100 million, which implied a decline of US$13,799 million compared to the close of the previous month (see Graph 5.1). Said decline was explained fundamentally by payments of National Treasury debt, the decrease in current accounts in dollars of financial entities at the BCRA (associated with the reduction in deposits), and sales of dollars by the Central Bank.

During August the nominal peso/United States dollar exchange rate was located above the foreign exchange reference zone. Starting from the Monday following the primary elections, the nominal exchange rate registered an upward trend, ending the month at 58.08, a 35% increase above the close of July.

In turn, the multilateral real exchange rate also increased. In this way, it concluded August at a value of 147.8, exceeding the maximum value recorded in 2018 (see Graph 5.2).
