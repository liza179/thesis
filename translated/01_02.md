# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information
Communication No: 39.620

## Monetary Situation (January 2001)

The main variables of the monetary market showed a very favorable evolution in January. Deposits and reserves of the financial system increased, while interest rates returned to levels similar to those shown 4 months before. As for loans to the private sector, the only lines that showed increases were those associated with consumption: mortgage and personal loans.

During January, there was an important recovery of deposits, especially in time deposits from the private sector. Considering monthly average figures, fixed-term deposits from the private sector were $1,350 million (2.4%) higher than the average shown in December, and reached their historical maximum. Sight deposits from the private sector also showed an increase, although somewhat smaller (1.6%). Sight accounts from the public sector, on the other hand, showed declines.

Following seasonal behavior, monetary circulation increased compared to the average of the previous month, basically due to the effect of the increase in the second half of December (although if end-of-month figures are considered, there was a decline in this variable).

The increase in deposits and monetary circulation on one hand, and the need to comply with the quarterly position November-January for the integration of liquidity requirements on the other, determined that the average stock of international reserves of the financial system increased almost US$1,900 million compared to the December average.

Finally, it is noted that domestic interest rates were declining throughout the month, and ended at the lowest levels since September 2000. The decline in interest rates is a determining factor, given its implications for credit demand. Interest rates on interbank loans were those that showed the largest declines throughout January: 6 and 5 percentage points, in operations in pesos and dollars, respectively, and at the end of the month the differential between currencies was practically non-existent.

## Private Banks (data as of November 2000)

The total assets of the group of private banks registered a decline of 2.4% during November 2000, due mainly to the decrease of 5.4% in the item "Other credits from financial intermediation" and the decline in available funds (10.2%). The behavior of both items was strongly associated with the decline in the integration of liquidity requirements. Although a decrease in the holding of public securities was also observed, credit to the public sector (public securities and loans to the public sector) increased 1.6%. As for alternative sources of funding, negotiable obligations registered a decline of 0.8%, while loan lines from abroad decreased 2.0%.

In November 2000, private banks recorded profits equivalent to 7.3% of net equity in annualized terms. The increase in profitability compared to the previous month was due particularly to the increase in results generated by holding financial assets and, secondly, to the decline in amounts charged to loan loss provisions. Accumulated gains in October and November 2000 (4.0% in relation to net equity, in annualized terms) were lower compared to those of the two previous quarters (4.6% in the second and 5.5 in the third) due to the low profitability of October 2000.

Due to modifications in the Monthly Reporting Regime, portfolio quality information is not available at this date.
The total capital requirement of private banks registered a slight increase of 0.3% in November, explained almost entirely by the increase in capital requirement for credit risk and interest rate risk (0.3%). Capital integration decreased slightly (0.1%) in the analyzed period, especially due to the decline in basic net equity. The variations in total capital requirement and integration caused a slight decrease in integration excess, which in terms of total capital requirement went from 50.7% to 50.1%. Finally, capital integration in terms of risk-weighted assets according to Basel fell 0.2 percentage points, placing itself at a level (20.1%) much higher than what is established by local regulation and by international minimum standards.
