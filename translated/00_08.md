# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information

## Monetary Situation (month of July)

During July, monetary and financial variables evolved, in general, positively. Deposits continued to grow, international reserves of the financial system increased, and interest rates presented on average levels lower than those observed in June. However, loans to the private sector showed a decline.

Private deposits increased on average 0.8% ($640 million), equivalent to an annualized growth of 10.4%. Continuing with the trend observed during recent months, fixed-term deposits were the placements that increased the most during the month. Savings accounts also show an important average increase due to the seasonal effect from the payment of the mid-year bonus in the last days of June and the first days of July.

In July, the international reserves of the financial system, measured as the sum of reserves in gold and foreign currency at the BCRA and the integration of minimum liquidity requirements at the correspondent abroad, increased $900 million with respect to the average of June and reached a level of $33,400 million. This behavior of international reserves was associated fundamentally with the seasonal increase in monetary circulation that increased 3.8%. For its part, the integration of minimum liquidity requirements increased 1.5% and, regarding its composition, passive repos for the BCRA increased their participation and represented around 64% of the total integration of liquidity requirements.

Considering the average as of July 26, loans to the private sector decreased 0.6%. Commercial loans that had halted their decline in June, fell again, while the growth rate of mortgages decelerated. For its part, an important increase in loans to the public sector was observed ($730 million) linked in large part to operations with the Trust Fund for Provincial Development, at the end of June. Therefore, total loans increased almost $300 million.

Interest rates continued to decline during July in a context of market liquidity and falling country risk. Interest rates for fixed-term deposits of more than one million pesos at 30 days maturity were reduced 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points, for operations in pesos and dollars respectively. For its part, interest rates in the short-term loan market between financial entities remained unchanged, observing a differential between currencies practically null.

## Private Banks (data as of May 2000) (1)

During May 2000, total assets of private banks registered a slight increase of 0.6%, mainly produced by the increase in available funds and in loans to the non-financial private sector. For its part, total deposits of private banks rose $1,000 million (1.8%) in May 2000. As in the previous period, the largest increase occurred in fixed-term deposits in foreign currency. As for alternative sources of funding, both loan lines with abroad and negotiable obligations experienced a decline (7.0% and 0.8% respectively).

Private banks registered profits of 5.4% (annualized) of net equity during May 2000. Benefits increased with respect to the previous month mainly due to the decline in loan loss provisions and the increase in results from services. The profitability accumulated in the present year as of May reached –6% of net equity, which represented a significant decrease compared to the figure observed in the same period one year before (4%). This decline in profitability had its origins in higher loan loss provisions and administrative expenses.
The quality of the loan portfolio of private banks experienced a slight deterioration in May. The irregular portfolio in terms of financing rose 0.1 percentage points, reaching 8.1%, while the irregular portfolio net of provisions in terms of financing went from 1.7% to 1.8%. For its part, credit risk, measured as the irregular portfolio net of provisions in terms of net equity, increased from 8.5% to 8.7%.

In terms of the first five months of this year, although a persistent deterioration in the quality of the loan portfolio was observed, the decrease in the degree of equity exposure to credit risk stood out, as a consequence of the significant increase in provisions (as of December 1999, the irregular portfolio net of provisions represented 11.5% of net equity).

The total capital requirement of private banks registered a slight decline of $60 million (0.9%), explained by the decrease in capital requirement for credit risk. For its part, capital integration decreased $70 million (0.6%) due to the increase in deductible accounts. The decline in capital requirement caused an increase in the excess of integration, which in terms of total capital requirement went from 53.0% to 53.4%.

Tables are attached with the evolution of the main variables.
