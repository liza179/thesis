# CONTENTS

**1. Summary 1**
- The average level of M2 (approximately $109,800 million) was again positioned near the lower limit of the range provided for in the 2006 Monetary Program (barely 1.8% above the minimum established for June and 5.1% below the upper limit). In this way, the Central Bank met the target set for the second quarter of 2006 and accumulates twelve consecutive quarters of compliance.

- M2 registered a monthly increase of $1,300 million (1.2%), approximately half the increase observed in June over the last 2 years. During the first semester of the year, the average monthly increase in seasonally adjusted M2 was almost one percentage point lower than that of the second semester of 2005. Private M2 showed similar behavior (which allows excluding the volatility generated by public sector placements), whose year-over-year rate of change decreased by approximately 4 p.p. compared to the end of 2005.

- In the month there was a significant increase in fixed-term placements ($3,120 million), from both the public and private sectors. This behavior would be influenced by the regulatory changes that the BCRA has been implementing with the objective of encouraging the lengthening of the funding terms of financial entities. In this sense, at the end of June the BCRA authorized a new modality of fixed-term deposits at variable interest rates although with a minimum guaranteed fixed interest rate, for deposits with a minimum term of 180 days.

- The BCRA continued with its prudential policy of accumulating international reserves. Its monetary effect was compensated in the month mainly by sterilization carried out through the placement of LEBAC and NOBAC, and by the contractionary effect of public sector operations, which cancelled temporary advances with the BCRA with resources deposited in the local financial system.

- During the month the BCRA increased active repo rates on 2 occasions, by 0.25 p.p. each and passive repo rates by 0.25 p.p. on one occasion. At the end of the month the BCRA was offering 7-day active repos at 8% and taking passive repos at 5.25% for 1-day terms and at 5.75% for 7 days. The call market continued showing great activity and rising interest rates. Passive interest rates remained relatively stable, as did active interest rates, with the exception of current account advances rate which fell due to greater relative participation of large companies, which generally access lower interest rates.

- Loans to the private sector continued growing and, considering those granted in pesos and foreign currency, increased around $2,500 million, an increase that in nominal terms equals 4.2%.

- At the end of June, the stock of international reserves was positioned at US$25,490 million after increasing US$1,328 million (5%) compared to the previous month. In real terms and according to the Multilateral Real Exchange Rate Index, in June the peso appreciated 1.2% with respect to the basket of currencies of its main trading partners, due mainly to the appreciation with respect to the Brazilian real, while

 almost all of the increase. During 2006 this segment of private

 rise in offered interest rates and also favored by the measures

 million (-1.8%).
# Similar increase was recorded in consumer financing,
which grew $860 million (5.7%). As was anticipated in the previous monetary report, the increase was due, in part, to higher sales of appliances and televisions motivated by the football world championship. In this sense, financing Chart 4.2 with credit cards increased $330 million (5.1%) in

Interbank Markets

Repo Market1
In June, the BCRA increased the rates of active repos on two occasions and that of passive repos on one occasion. In each of them, the increase was 0.25 p.p.. Thus, at the end of the month the BCRA was granting active repos at 8% for 7 days and receiving funds in passive repos paying 5.25% for operations with a 1-day term and 5.75% if they were agreed upon for 7 days. In the same sense, the interest rates of the average market, which also encompass operations in the Chart 5.3 Repos Arranged by the BCRA thousands of (daily average amounts, monthly average balances) thousands of millions of $ millions of $ market segment at 1 day term that the BCRA does not intervene in, also increased. In the 1-day term segment they registered an increase of 0.7 p.p., while in the 7-day segment they grew 0.5 p.p..

The daily amount operated by the BCRA was, on average, $2,762 million, 15% less than in May (see Chart 5.3). However, the decline was due to a change in the composition of the stock by term bracket, in favor of 7-day operations and to the detriment of those agreed upon for 1 day. Thus, in short, the average balance of passive repos increased 2.6%, and came to be positioned at $5,738 million. For its part, the balance of active repos continued to be a relatively small amount and was positioned at $189 million.

## Interbank Market¹

In a month characterized by high liquidity needs on the part of companies, linked to the first installment of the advance income tax and the payment of bonuses, the interbank market showed great activity, registering important volumes operated and rising interest rates.

The interest rate of operations at 1 business day, which currently represent 74% of operations, had been positioned during the first half of June around 5.5%. However, in the middle of the month, in line with the maturity of the first installment of the advance income tax, it reached a peak above 9% and subsequently stabilized at around 8%. In this way, it registered an average of 7.1%, which implies an increase of 1.2 p.p. with respect to the previous month. Similar behavior could be seen in the interest rate of 7-day term operations, although with a smaller increase; they registered in the month an average of 7.7%, 0.6 p.p. above May.

The amount of call money operated rose around $100 million in June and reached an average level above $1,000 million, which was the highest since December 2000 (see Chart 5.4), although in relation to deposits, its current level is somewhat more than half that of that time.

Pension and Retirement Fund Administrators

The investment portfolio of the Pension and Retirement Fund Administrators (AFJP) totaled $71,819 million as of June 15. This implied a decline in the portfolio value of close to 2% compared to the end of May.

With the information available as of June 15, it is observed that the items leading the decline of $1,537 million are Mutual Investment Funds with a decrease of $986 million or 15%, followed by the item containing shares of local companies that registered a decline of $470 million, or 5.5% compared to the last day of May. The item of foreign securities, for its part, also showed a sharp decline of $454 million or 6.1% compared to the amount recorded in the previous month. The remaining items of the Pension Funds (AFJPs) fail to offset collectively the decrease in the sum of the items just mentioned.

## Mutual Investment Funds

Mutual investment funds (FCI) in pesos again registered a patrimonial decline in June, this time of $1,196 million (9.6%), caused by a decrease in the equity and money market instrument assets (see Chart 7.8).

Chart 7.8

The patrimony of money market funds registered, toward mid-month, a contraction of $409 million that continued during the second half of the month (see Chart 7.9) totaling a net decline of $661 million (13.3%). This reduction is explained largely by the withdrawal of funds to cover the payment of income taxes during the first half of the month, and for the payment of salaries and bonuses at the end of the month, carried out mainly by large companies. The profitability of this type of funds ended at 5.20%.
