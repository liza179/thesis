# CONTENTS

1. Summary 1
   • In December, the Monetary Base (MB) was located for the tenth consecutive quarter within the bands of the Monetary Program, registering a level of $55,827 million, more than $1,000 million below the upper limit established for year-end. In nominal terms, the MB decreased 0.1% in December and accumulated in 2005 a decline in real terms of 1.7%.

2. Monetary Program 2
   • During December the BCRA continued with the prudential policy of accumulation of international reserves, which made it possible that at the end of 2005 these exceeded US$28,000 million, more than tripling the minimum registered at the beginning of 2003.

3. International Reserves 3
   • In mid-December, the government ordered the cancellation of the total debt contracted with the IMF with international reserves of the BCRA, to which, as a counterpart, an untransferable letter in dollars would be delivered for a period of 10 years that will amortize entirely at maturity and will accrue semi-annual interest similar to the yield of international reserves. The payment of the debt with the IMF was implemented in 5 business days, taking effect on January 3, 2006 for a total of US$9,530 million. The operation was neutral in monetary terms, given that, since these were foreign exchange movements only, it had no impact on the MB.

4. Interest Rates 4

4.1. Securities Issued by the BCRA 4
   • At the beginning of the month the BCRA increased by 0.5 p.p. the interest rates for passive repo operations, arranging operations at 4.5% and 5% at 1 day and 7 days respectively since then. For its part, active repo rates had already been increased by the same magnitude in November, with which in the 7-day operations segment the corridor of reference interest rates went to 5%-6%.

4.2. Interfinancial Markets 4

4.2.1 Repo Market 4
   • Call rates continued to exhibit high volatility during December. In line with the increase in repo rates, the average passive interest rate increased by 0.5 p.p., registering an average during December of 5.2%. Similarly, the interest rate for advances in current account increased by 0.3 p.p. in the last month, reaching an average of 17.7%, while for documents at sole signature the interest rate increased by 0.6 p.p. positioning itself at an average of 11.8%.

5. Monetary Aggregates and Liquidity 7
   • In December the monetary aggregates presented significant growth, linked to the strong seasonal increase in means of payment. The M2 registered a monthly increase of 6.4% ($6,280 million), although in seasonally adjusted terms, the monthly variation was less than 3%. The broadest monetary aggregate in pesos (M3) presented a monthly increase of 3.2% ($5,060 million), which corresponded entirely to the increase in means of payment, which was partially offset by the decrease in time deposits.

6. Loans 10
   • In December loans to the private sector again increased their growth rate and registered an increase of 4.3% ($2,170 million) in the month. In this way, they came to represent 9.4% of GDP, registering an increase of 1.3 p.p. during the year. Likewise, some lending lines again registered record growth since the recovery began after the 2001-2002 crisis, as is the case with mortgage loans and credit card financing.

 2. Monetary Program

 In December, the MB was located for the tenth consecutive quarter within the bands of the Monetary Program, registering a level of $55,827 million, more than $1,000 million below the upper limit established for year-end (see Chart 2.1). In nominal terms, the MB decreased 0.1% in December and accumulated in 2005 a decline in real terms of 1.7%.

 52 In December, in addition to the cancellation of the monthly installment provided for in the "matching" scheme, some financial entities
 anticipated the cancellation of part of their debts with the BCRA. Altogether, these operations resulted in a reduction of the MB of
 50 $914 million. During 2005, this new regime that allowed
 entities to cancel their debts in advance for

 projections, the targets for the M2 aggregate were established,
 which are indicated in Table 1.

 In the month under analysis, the stock of reserves increased

 million, the outflow of reserves for this reason was more than
 compensated by the placement of debt in dollars (US$600 million)
 and by the inflow of funds from international financial institutions
 (US$700 million), generating an increase in reserves of US$623
 million. For its part, the BCRA's intervention in the foreign

In December, the interest rates for LEBAC and NOBAC
remained at levels similar to those recorded in November.
Thus, at the end of December the yield paid for the placement of
the 49-day LEBAC was 6.8%, while that of 63 days reached 6.9%. Furthermore, the NOBAC with a 2-year term with variable coupon
based on the rate paid by wholesale fixed-term deposits
(BADLAR) in the private banks segment continued
to be one of the most attractive instruments, and was placed at year-end
at a rate of 11.9%. The aforementioned yields imply

 In December the monetary aggregates presented significant growth, linked to the seasonal increase in means of payment, associated with the collection of bonuses and year-end festivities (see Graph 5.1.1).

The M2 showed a monthly increase of 6.4% ($6,280 million), which resulted in a year-on-year increase of 25%. In seasonally adjusted terms, the monthly variation was significantly lower, being less than 3%. The majority of M2 growth corresponded to transactional deposits that increased $4,040

million (6.9%). For its part, currency in circulation showed an increase of $2,240 million (5.8%), although in seasonally adjusted terms the variation was negative (around -0.8%).

The increase in sight deposits was distributed homogeneously between public sector deposits and private sector deposits, which increased $1,690 million (9.8%) and $2,340 million (5.6%) respectively. The increase in public
Graph 5.1.2 deposits responded to the income of tax funds and resources from the placement of short-term debt by the National Treasury. In the case of private deposits, the increase

Both fixed-term deposits of the public sector and those of the private sector presented negative variations in December, which were around $520 million (-4.5%) and $460 million (-1.2%) respectively. The decrease in public deposits was related to the placement of National Treasury Bills to decentralized public agencies at the maturity of their fixed terms. While the fall in private placements was due to the transfer of resources toward transactional deposits and currency in circulation in the public's hands, in response to the greater liquidity needs typical of the month under analysis. It should be noted that the decreases occurred both in the adjustable segment with CER

Chart 5.2.1 as well as in the traditional one.

In this way, the average stock of deposits in foreign currency remained at the end of 2005 at a level similar to that of the

previous year. Nevertheless, although the total stock remained practically unchanged, its composition was modified in favor of private sector placements, which registered an annual increase of 40.7%, while those of the public sector were reduced by 65%, basically as a consequence of the payments of internal and external obligations made by the government.

 also reduced during the month their holdings of LEBAC and

 ratio widens to 3.6 p.p. in public banks and to 1 p.p. in private banks

7.1. Foreign Exchange Market

From mid-December onwards, upward pressures were observed on the peso's exchange rate against the dollar. In effect, in the spot market the peso depreciated 1.6% on average against the dollar, while in the futures market⁸ the depreciation of the local currency against the dollar was greater, reaching 1.9%. In relation to the euro, a depreciation of the peso of around 2.2% was also observed, while against the real the peso appreciated 1.6%. In real terms, according to the Multilateral Real Exchange Rate Index, the peso appreciated 0.2% against a basket of currencies from its main trading partners and accumulated an appreciation of 3.2% over the last 12 months (see Chart 7.1.1).

In relation to traded amounts, in the spot foreign exchange market, operations arranged through the Electronic Operations System (SIOPEL) averaged US$174 million daily, a level 6% lower than in November. 80% of the operations corresponded to financial entities and the rest to the BCRA. For its part, in the Electronic Brokers Market, the daily traded amount increased compared to the previous month, reaching US$94 million in December.

In the Rosario Forward Market, the average daily amount traded was around US$75 million in December, decreasing 17% compared to November. The BCRA's intervention in this market continued increasing, going from 11.2% in

 The stock exchanges in the rest of the countries in the region again showed mixed results, in the same sense as in November. Thus, while equity markets in Brazil and Mexico rose again, 4.8% and 5.8% respectively; the IPSA index of the Santiago de Chile Stock Exchange registered a monthly decrease of 3.1%. In all cases, prices at the end of 2005 were higher than those in effect a year earlier.

 The average daily amount traded of the securities that make up the MERVAL was at $79 million, a level similar to that of Chart 7.2.2.1 the previous month and in line with the daily average traded in 2005.

 During December, the Federal Reserve again increased 0.25 p.p. its reference interest rate. Likewise, the governments of Brazil and Argentina announced early payments of their debts with the International Monetary Fund. However, none of these developments had a significant impact on the perception of risks in emerging economies. Thus, the EMBI+ indices for both the total of emerging countries and for Latin American countries remained relatively stable. The same occurred in the case of that corresponding to the local economy, which in the year showed a notable reduction, mainly as a consequence of the completion of the public debt restructuring process, with which 2005 ended at 504 bps.

7.2.3. Institutional Investors9

7.2.3.1. Pension Fund Administrators

The investment portfolio of the Pension Fund Administrators (AFJP) ended the year at $66,859 million, 2.8% above the level recorded one month earlier and 25.5% higher than that in force at the end of 2004. During the month, the items that contributed most to the increase in these investors' portfolio were those composed of public debt securities and those comprised of placements in mutual funds.

The increase in the prices of sovereign bonds in pesos drove the growth of the AFJP portfolio segment invested in public securities. Thus, in December, this type of placements increased by $470 million (1.3%) and the increase was explained mainly by the higher balance recorded in PRO 12 bonds. Their holdings of Discount bonds in pesos and dollars also showed increases.

Regarding holdings of mutual funds, growth was evident in those that invest in equity of Latin American countries, in line with the good performance shown by the rest of the region's stock exchanges during the period. In total, AFJP fund holdings increased by $470 million (12.9%).

In December, financial trusts once again showed an increase, this time of $200 million (18%). This increase was mainly due to the increase in participation in the Galtrust I trust, which corresponds to the securitization of provincial loans granted by Banco Galicia.

During the year, the increase in AFJP investment portfolio was concentrated in holdings of national public securities, whose quotations were boosted following the completion of public debt restructuring and in the growth of "Other Investments". This last segment includes, in addition to participations in financial trusts, negotiable futures and options contracts, where holdings of coupons from new sovereign bonds linked to GDP are registered. Likewise, placements in equity securities increased, in accordance with the positive results shown by their prices during the year. Finally, AFJPs also had active participation in the important dynamism shown by mutual funds during 2005 (see Graph 7.2.3.1.1).

7.2.3.2. Mutual Investment Funds (FCI)

The mutual funds in pesos presented in December a patrimonial increase close to $489 million (5.7%), which was led by the rise in fixed income fund equity. During the year, mutual funds accumulated an increase of $3,452 million, equivalent to 62% of equity at the end of 2004. The most notable increases occurred in fixed income funds (330%) and equity funds (166%), while fixed-term and money market funds, which concentrate the majority of resources, presented a slight negative variation (-6.4%) (see Graph 7.2.3.2.1).

13 Monthly Monetary Report – DECEMBER 2005
# VARIABLE INCOME FUNDS

Variable Income Funds fell $135 million below the level at the end of November, which represents a negative monthly variation of 3.8%. As in the previous month, this decline is explained in part by the option of institutional clients to transfer resources from money market to remunerated sight accounts, which continue to offer a more attractive interest rate. On the other hand, it should be noted that at the end of December the National Securities Commission modified the regulations[10] relating to these funds, establishing that as of February 27, 2006 assets valued on an accrual basis (fixed-term deposits, BCRA bills and securities repurchase agreements) may not exceed 50% of the fund's portfolio. In turn, the definition of required liquidity margin was modified, which changed from being 45% of the total assets of the fund to being 80% of the total percentage that the fund maintains in portfolios of assets valued on an accrual basis, with effectiveness also as of February 27, 2006. Finally, effective as of January 30, 2006, it was established that the weighted average life of the portfolio be equal to or greater than 20 days, excluding assets that comprise the liquidity margin, and that the maturity of assets valued at realization price that are incorporated into the fund's assets does not exceed 180 days.

For its part, variable income funds ended December $391 million above the level at the end of November (11.9%). This was due to the inflow of new resources, coming mainly from institutional investors (AFJP, ART, etc.) and large companies, given that the value of their share units, whose evolution is closely linked to that of the MERVAL index, maintains a negative trend (see Chart 7.2.3.2.2). In effect, the return of these funds went from 25.1% in 2004 to 16.2% in 2005.

# FIXED INCOME FUNDS

Fixed income funds recorded a positive equity variation in December, close to $221 million (14.8%), which is explained by the inflow of new resources (see Chart 7.2.3.2.3). In terms of return, these funds yielded a return of 14.3% in 2005, 2 percentage points lower than that recorded during 2004. It should be noted that at the end of December the National Securities Commission modified the regulations[10] relating to these funds, establishing that as of February 27, 2006 these funds must have assets valued at market with public offering of 60% or more of their portfolio.

Finally, the equity of mixed income funds increased $13 million in December (6.2%) and their return was 22.5% in 2005.

 The underlying assets that stood out in the month were

 polarized in December both the role of trustor and
 trustee, observing the same trend for the complete year.
