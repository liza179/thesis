Monetary Report | October 2009 | BCRA | 2 1. Summary
• The BCRA's policies have demonstrated the capacity to generate stability in monetary, financial and exchange rate variables. Having overcome several episodes of turbulence, the persistence of these policies has allowed for a change in the expectations of economic agents. As a result of this unprecedented fact in recent decades, improvements in monetary and financial variables have occurred and a gradual recovery of the level of activity, which led to monetary aggregates beginning to follow a growth path from mid-year onwards. In October this trend persisted and M2 registered a monthly average balance of $179,150 million, which implies an increase of 0.3% with respect to September and 10.5% with respect to October of the previous year. For its part, the broader monetary aggregate in pesos, M3, showed growth of 1% with respect to the previous month and 4.1% with respect to October 2008.

• Private sector deposits in pesos increased 2% with respect to September, with growth in both sight deposits and time deposits. The increase in time deposits reached $1,600 million and was concentrated in the retail deposits segment (up to $1 million). However, in the second half of October, wholesale fixed-term deposits showed renewed dynamism.

• The proportion of liquid assets in pesos (current accounts at the Central Bank, cash, net repos with the Central Bank and LEBAC and NOBAC) of banks in terms of deposits in the same currency, amounted to 36.3%. As occurred in September, a decrease in the net position of repos with the Central Bank was observed, which was more than offset by the increase in LEBAC and NOBAC holdings.

• Within the framework of financial stability and recovery of money demand prevailing in the local economy, the Central Bank continued with its countercyclical policy, through a new reduction of 0.25 percentage points in interest rates for repo operations. The interest rates for passive repos were set at 9% and 9.5%, for 1 and 7 days, respectively, while the interest rates for active repos of 1 and 7 days moved to 11% and 11.5%, respectively. In this way, over the last four months the reference interest rates have accumulated a reduction of 1.5 percentage points.

• Short-term interest rates in the local market decreased in accordance with the cut in reference interest rates ordered by the Central Bank. In the most dynamic segment of the interbank loan market, that of operations for 1 business day, a decrease in average interest rates of 0.3 percentage points was observed with respect to September. Meanwhile, the monthly average of the interest rate paid by private banks in the wholesale segment of deposits of up to 35 days (BADLAR) stood at 11.8%, with a decline of 0.4 percentage points with respect to September. On the other hand, among the interest rates charged for loans, the one applied to overdrafts in current accounts with prior agreement, granted to companies, for up to 7 days for amounts exceeding $10 million, decreased 1.5 percentage points with respect to the average observed in September, standing at 12.4%.

• Loans in pesos to the private sector show a gradual acceleration in their growth rate, with particularly dynamic performance in financing destined for consumption. In effect, in October the growth of total loans in pesos to the private sector was around $1,200 million, surpassing 1% monthly variation for the first time since July.

• In October, the Central Bank conducted a new auction of interest rate swaps from fixed to variable (BADLAR private banks), one of the mechanisms it has implemented to promote longer-term credit. On this occasion, the proposals received ($260 million notional) far exceeded the total amount auctioned ($150 million notional), with $60 million being awarded. [Text appears to be incomplete in the original]
their adjudications in all the tendered tranches and the cut-off interest rates were located at 15%, 15.75% and 16.5%, for contracts of 3, 4 and 5 years, respectively.

 Based on the above, the stock of titles issued by the
 Central Bank increased 8%, ending the month at

 In October, and as mentioned, the Central Bank continued
 its countercyclical liquidity policy and arranged a new
 reduction of 0.25 p.p. in the interest rates for its repo
 operations. The interest rates for passive repos were set
 at 9% and 9.50%, for 1 and

 by the Central Bank, the average interest rate in the
 interbank market decreased 0.25 p.p. compared to
 September, standing at 9.1%. In particular, in the market
 segment that concentrates the largest amount of
 operations, that of those conducted at 1 business day,
 a decrease in interest rates was observed, of 0.3 p.p.
 compared to September (see Chart 5.4).

 The amounts traded in this market continued at histori-
 cally low levels, having remained almost unchanged in
 the last seven months, with an average amount traded
 close to $550 million per day.

For its part, the monthly average of the interest rate paid by private banks on retail placements, for identical term, was reduced by 0.5 p.p., standing at 11.1%.

On the other hand, in the interest rate futures market, a significant increase (74%) was observed in the quantity of BADLAR futures contracts closed in October, as well as a decrease in agreed prices. At the end of the month, the implicit rate in the contracts with maturity on December 31 was located at 11.5% with a decrease of 1.8 p.p. in the month, while the rate corresponding to the contract with maturity at the end of the first quarter of 2010 was 12.35%, 1.2 p.p. below the rate it registered at the end of September.

## Active Interest Rates¹⁴

Like the rest of short-term interest rates, active rates declined during October. In particular, in the most traded segments, decreases greater than those observed in passive interest rates were recorded, with a reduction in spreads.

Among commercial loans granted by private banks in Capital and GBA, the average interest rate for advances on current account with prior agreement, granted to companies, for up to 7 days of term and for amounts exceeding $10 million, was located at 12.4% with a decrease of 1.5 p.p. with respect to the average observed in September (see Graph 5.6). Meanwhile, the interest rate for advances on current account for the total of terms would have declined 0.7 p.p. with respect to the September average.

For their part, the interest rates of the three financing modalities through documents (discounted, sole signature, and purchased) recorded a similar evolution, with a decrease with respect to September. In particular, the average rate for sole signature documents would have decreased 0.6 p.p. with respect to the September average.

Meanwhile, according to preliminary information for Capital and GBA, the interest rates for personal loans would have recorded a decrease of 0.9 p.p. with respect to the previous month. For its part, the interest rates for mortgage loans to families would have remained at the September level, while the interest rate corresponding to financing with pledge guarantee would have declined 0.9 p.p. with respect to the September average.

## Interest Rate Swap Operations

Among the measures adopted to preserve the dynamics of credit, the Central Bank continued providing financial entities with hedging instruments against movements in interest rates, which would allow them to

During October, stock markets worldwide generally performed well until mid-month, after which they began to lose value. For this reason, the global MSCI6 declined by 1.8% during the month. With respect to regional performance, the MSCI index for Latin America was the only one that rose, with an increase of 1.4%, while that of European stock exchanges declined by 3.6% and Japan's MSCI fell by 2.5%. For its part, the U.S. S&P 500 showed practically no changes between opening and closing (see Graph 7.1).

The MERVAL index for Argentina also showed good performance during October, ending the month at 2,116 points, with a monthly increase of 2%, measured in pesos. Like stock markets in the rest of the world, the MERVAL had heterogeneous evolution throughout the month with better performance during the first weeks of October. Compared to a year ago, the local stock exchange also registered a significant increase of 109.3%, while year-to-date it has accumulated a gain of 96%.

The historical volatility of the MERVAL - 22 trading sessions - in annualized terms and measured in dollars, was 36% during October, 12.5 percentage points higher than during the previous month. On the other hand, the expected volatility for the S&P 500 (measured by the VIX) averaged 24% in October, that is, 0.7 percentage points less than during September, the lowest value since October of last year (see Graph 7.2).

The average daily volume traded on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange during October was $70 million, which represents an increase of $20 million from the amount traded in September, although it was 33% lower than that observed in the same period of the previous year.

During October, sovereign risk indicators remained practically unchanged, with the exception of the local market, where the announcement of reopening of sovereign debt swap had a positive impact. Specifically, the EMBI+, which measures the spreads of emerging countries combined, declined 3 basis points, closing at 323 basis points. Meanwhile, the spread of Latin American debt in foreign currency increased by 8 basis points, ending at 362 basis points. On the other hand, Argentina's spread declined by 63 basis points, ending the month at 721, while Brazil's increased by 6 basis points and finished October at 240 basis points. The EMBI of Argentine debt reached its lowest value in the last thirteen months. When considering Credit Default Swaps (CDS) contracts, it is observed that the spread of Argentina's 5-year contracts (the most traded segment) declined by 77 basis points, while the spread of Brazil's CDS at the same maturity increased by 10 basis points (see Graph 7.3). On the other hand, the yield curve of public securities in pesos also reflected an improvement (see Graph 7.4).

The volume traded in public securities (on average daily) continued at reduced levels, although an important increase was registered compared to September when it stood at $910 million, $200 million more than the previous month.

Mutual Investment Funds

Like last month, mutual investment funds (FCI) increased,
showing increases both in the local currency section and in
the foreign currency section. The total net equity at the end
of the month stood at $16,506 million and was 9.4% higher
than at the end of September.

On one hand, FCI in pesos ended October at $14,511
million, with an increase of 10.5% in relation to September
(see Chart 7.5). After two months of decline, the segment
that registered the greatest growth was the money market
Chart 7.6 segment. The equity of this class of FCI closed October at

Finally, the equity segment showed a monthly decline of 4.6%, concluding October with a net worth of $2,100 million. The decline was due to the lower number of shares registered.

Regarding FCIs in foreign currency, it is worth mentioning that they ended the month with a net worth close to $2,000 million, showing increases in practically all segments.

**Chart 7.7 Financial Trusts7**

*millions $ Underlying Assets In October, the issuances of financial trusts (amounts issued) totaled $624 million (see Chart 7.6), with an increase of 23% ($116 million) compared to the previous month. For its part, the number of placements continued to grow, registering a total of 19 operations in the month, 3 more than in September. Meanwhile, a decrease of 32% was evident in relation to the same month of the previous year, despite having recorded one more operation than in that period. This was due to the fact that the average amount per placement rose in October to $33 million compared to $51 million in the same month of the previous year.*

As for underlying assets, those linked to consumption continued to predominate (76% of the total), although commercial credits had an important presence in comparison with records from previous years by representing 23% of the total. Regarding the securitized amounts, consumer financing, in total, remained stable compared to the previous month. However, within this type of underlying asset, personal loans doubled (see Chart 7.7) while credit card coupons registered a decrease of 66%. Meanwhile, the securitization of commercial credits practically tripled compared to the previous month, driven mainly by a placement of a financial entity of $104 million, whose trust assets were loans granted to finance infrastructure projects. It should be noted that in recent years financial entities have not been securitizing commercial credits, with the last case occurring at the end of 2005.
