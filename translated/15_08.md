## 1. Summary1

• In August, the broadest monetary aggregate in pesos (M3) registered a monthly growth of 2%, maintaining its year-over-year change close to 35%. All of its components showed increases.

• Among deposits from the private sector, fixed-term placements continued to stand out, and in particular those made in amounts less than $1 million. In August, retail fixed-term deposits increased 5.3% and accumulated growth of 49% over the last twelve months. Thus, they sustained the upward trend that began to show following the implementation of the minimum interest rate scheme for this deposit segment. In particular, it is worth noting that since the increase in minimum interest rates established on July 27 came into effect, placements of less than $1 million accumulated an increase of $11,800 million (6.4%).

• The increase in peso deposits allowed the continuation of growth in loans to the private sector in local currency. These financing arrangements rose 2.4% ($15,460 million) in August and accumulated year-over-year growth of 30.7%. Loans arranged through securities and those directed essentially toward consumption led the month's growth.

• In the aforementioned framework, the liquidity ratio of financial entities in the peso segment decreased 0.4 percentage points with respect to July, although it continued at elevated levels: 38.8% in terms of peso deposits. The reduction was explained by the decrease recorded in excess liquidity, particularly associated with the net repo balance.

• Among passive interest rates, those in the retail segment aligned with the new minimum values established by the Central Bank at the end of July, while those for deposits of larger amounts remained relatively stable. Thus, the monthly average of the interest rate paid by private entities for fixed-term deposits of up to $100 thousand and up to 35 days maturity was placed at 23.5%, increasing 0.8 percentage points with respect to the July average and aligning with the new minimum levels effective since the end of last month. For its part, the BADLAR of private banks averaged 20.9%.

• Most active interest rates remained stable or decreased with respect to July. In particular, the interest rate on advances to companies of more than $10 million and up to 7 days maturity fell 1 percentage point, averaging 25.2% in August, while the monthly average of the interest rate for pawn loans decreased 0.6 percentage points placing itself at 24.4% and that of mortgages fell 3.4 percentage points, placing itself at 21.6%. For its part, the weighted average interest rate of personal loans actually granted continued to be placed below the maximum levels established by the Central Bank, and was 36.5% in August.

to financial trusts. In this report, "amounts granted" or "new loans" is understood to mean loans (new and renewals) arranged in a period.
In contrast, the variation in the balance is composed of loans arranged, minus amortizations and cancellations of the period.

 of these instruments. In parallel, operations were
 conducted in the secondary market of the instruments
 issued by the Central Bank and the National Government,
 of longer terms than those issued by the Central Bank,
 for the purpose of establishing a yield curve appropriate
 to the stated objectives. Upon closing the month, the
 nominal balance in circulation of LEBAC increased $7,912
 million compared to the end of July, positioning itself at
 $345,962 million. The demand for LEBAC from financial
 entities, fundamentally public ones, contributed most to
 the increase in the balance.

# INTERFINANCIAL MARKETS1

In August, the average interest rates in the interfinancial market decreased with respect to July, while intra-monthly volatility was reduced compared to that observed in previous months. In the unsecured market (call), the interest rate for 1 business day operations averaged 22.8%, positioning itself 1.2 p.p. below the value registered in July. Likewise, the average interest rate for 1 business day operations between financial entities in the secured market (REPO wheel) stood at 24%, verifying a monthly decline of 1 p.p. (see Graph 5.4). The average daily amount traded increased $200 million in August, totaling approximately $8,500 million.

## Passive Interest Rates1

The interest rates paid by financial entities for their fixed-term deposits in pesos registered increases in August.

In the retail segment, the monthly average of the interest rate paid by private entities for fixed-term deposits of up to $100 thousand and up to 35 days of term stood at 23.5%, increasing 0.8 p.p. with respect to the July average and aligning with the new minimum levels in effect since the end of last month.

In the wholesale segment, the BADLAR of private banks – interest rate for fixed-term deposits of $1 million and more, 30-35 days of term – averaged 20.9%, registering an increase of 0.3 p.p. in the month (see Graph 5.5).

## Active Interest Rates1 11

In August, the majority of the interest rates applied on loans to the private sector remained stable or decreased with respect to the previous month.

Among commercial lines, the interest rates associated with overdrafts in current accounts showed stable levels with respect to what was registered in July. The monthly average of the interest rate for overdrafts remained at 30.5%. Within this line, the interest rate for overdrafts to companies of more than $10 million and up to 7 days of term decreased 1 p.p., averaging 25.2% in August (Graph 5.6).

In the case of unsecured documents, the interest rate averaged 26.1%, a level similar to that registered in July. In contrast, the interest rate of discounted documents averaged 23.2%, increasing 1.4 p.p. in the month (Graph 5.7).

 and in foreign currency, registered an increase of
 $8,650 million (5%), reaching $182,760 million at the
 close of the month. As in July, fixed income funds in

Financial entities also reduced their securitizations in August, issuing around $160 million. The remainder corresponded to companies linked to agricultural activity, which securitized commercial credits.

## 8. Main Policy Measures of Other Central Banks

Among the policy measures of other central banks, those adopted in August by the People's Bank of China (PBoC) stood out, particularly in exchange rate matters, with strong impact on asset markets globally, and with possible consequences for future monetary policy of other central banks, including that of the U.S.

Indeed, on August 11, the PBoC decided to modify its exchange rate floating regime. Until that date, the PBoC set daily, at the beginning of trading, the exchange rate against the dollar (official yuan), while the market exchange rate could fluctuate ±2% with respect to that value. If the spot yuan value exceeded that band, the PBoC intervened in the foreign exchange market. As of August 11, the PBoC proceeded to set the official yuan exchange rate against the dollar taking into account market conditions from the previous day (see Chart 8.1). This modification of the exchange rate regime occurred in a context of dollar strengthening at the global level and of the yuan with respect to most other currencies (see Chart 8.2), in addition to a marked capital outflow (see Chart 8.3). Together with local growth indicators that point to a macroeconomic outlook with certain weakness. This led the PBoC to reduce its monetary policy interest rate (the one-year deposits rate) by 0.25 p.p. to 1.75% on August 25. In turn, it also reduced the reserve requirement rate applicable to large banks by 0.5 p.p. to 18% (see Chart 8.4).

China's modification of the exchange rate regime had impact on all asset markets, generating strong volatility. Among them, the commodities market, where a 22% drop in oil prices was registered between late July and August 24 (see Chart 8.5). However, the fear of further reductions in energy prices, together with deflationary pressures that a yuan devaluation has on a global scale, led markets and some directors of the U.S. Federal Reserve to practically rule out a hike in the federal funds rate target (FFR) for the next meeting on September 17. No

Finally, on August 14 the Central Bank of Chile (BCCh) decided to maintain its reference interest rate (Monetary Policy Rate -TPM-) at 3%. The BCCh made this decision in a context of a slight improvement in the activity level and an inflation rate that is moving away from the target (3% ± 1 p.p.).
