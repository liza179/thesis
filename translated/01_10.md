## Monetary Situation (September 2001)

During September, monetary variables showed positive behavior. Already from the fourth week of August, a change had been perceived in the negative evolution of previous months, a trend that continued throughout September. Thus, an increase was observed in deposits and international reserves and a fall in interest rates.

Total deposits increased on average by $470 million (0.6%). The increase corresponded exclusively to private sector deposits which, on average, grew around $600 million (0.9%) and, considering end-of-month balances, $1,200 million. Time deposits explain in their entirety the deposit growth, evidencing an increase of 1.6% which, except for January, turned out to be the highest of the last twelve months.

International reserves of the financial system increased, on average, $2,830 million and $5,200 million when considering end-of-month balances. These figures reflect the effect of the intake of $4,000 million from a loan from the International Monetary Fund, which occurred on September 10. On the other hand, on the 13th of the month, the Contingent Program of Repos with foreign entities was partially activated, delivering part of the Central Bank's public securities portfolio in foreign currency in exchange for foreign exchange ($1,270 million). This operation produced an improvement in the quality of the Central Bank's international reserves.

With regard to loans to the non-financial private sector, although they continued to fall, they did so at a significantly slower pace, accumulating a decrease of 0.9% ($530 million) during the month.

Finally, interest rates remained at high levels during the first fortnight, showing declines from the third week onward. It should be noted that interbank loan interest rates decreased significantly, thus reaching very low levels, similar to those observed before the July crisis.

## Private Banks (data as of July 2001)

In July 2001, the total assets of private banks continued with the negative trend observed since the beginning of the year, registering a decrease of 6.3%. The fall in this item reflects the evolution of the main asset items. First, the decline in total loans (4.3%) due to the fall in loans to the non-financial private sector (3.5%) and interfinancial loans (28.5%), which in turn were partially replaced by active repos granted by the BCRA. Second, the decrease in the line "Other credits for financial intermediation" (7.4%), which in turn registered the negative effect of sales and purchases of foreign currency forwards. Another important factor in the contraction of total assets was the fall in available funds (14.9%), as a result of lower integration of minimum liquidity requirements and minimum cash—as a consequence of the significant drop in deposits evidenced in the month. Finally, the declining evolution of public securities prices caused, in particular, a fall in this item of 9.8%. On the other hand, the net assets of accounting duplications generated by repo, forward, and spot operations to be settled registered a decrease of 5.2%.

As for alternative funding sources, loan lines from abroad registered an increase of 2.6%, while negotiable securities contracted 0.9%.
# MONTHLY MONETARY AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Central Bank of the Argentine Republic
Financial Analysis Management and Information
September 2001

In July 2001, private banks registered profits corresponding to 5.1% of net equity in annualized terms. With respect to the previous month, a slight improvement was recorded due to higher interest income and the adjustment of accrued income tax for the aggregate of private banks. The loss derived from the result on assets, as a consequence of the decline in local financial asset prices, partially offset the two previous effects. Therefore, the first month of the third quarter of 2001 showed lower profits than the first two quarters of the year, which is mainly due to the fall in results on assets. Finally, the accumulated profitability of 2001 through July amounted to 7.2% of net equity in annualized terms.

Due to the modifications introduced in the methodology for calculating the minimum capital requirement for credit risk—according to Com. "A" 3307—the submission of information corresponding to the month of July 2001 has been postponed—according to Com. "A" 3331—.

Tables are attached with the evolution of the main variables.
