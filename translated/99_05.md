# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information
Communication No. 34.326

During April, deposits showed favorable behavior by increasing on average 0.6% (460 million pesos) accumulating an increase in the year of 2.6%. As in March, the growth of deposits was driven by fixed-term placements, especially those denominated in local currency. On the other hand, loans to the non-financial private sector show a decline of 280 million pesos. It is noteworthy that part of this decline is due to the fact that as of April 19, Banco Mendoza is no longer included in the information survey. The international reserves of the financial system experienced a slight decrease that accompanied the decline observed in monetary circulation.

Passive interest rates reflected the liquidity existing in the monetary market and, in most cases, experienced a sharp reduction, reaching the lowest levels since 1991. On the other hand, financial entities increased their integration of minimum liquidity requirements, maintaining their ratio with respect to deposits above 21%.

With respect to private banks during February 1999, a slight decline in total loans was observed (1.3%), which was due to the reduction in interbank financing and, to a greater extent, to a decrease in loans to residents abroad by a first-tier entity. Likewise, some entities continued reducing their financing through external lines, canceling those credits taken during the crises in Russia and Brazil.

Associated with the recovery of financial asset quotations and lower volatility in capital markets, the profitability of private banks registered in February a gain (in annualized terms) of 6.7% of net equity.

For its part, the irregular portfolio of private banks increased slightly, reaching 6.9% of financings. The increase in default rates originated in the consumer portfolio, fundamentally in those credits without preferred guarantees.

The excess capital integration of private banks recovered significantly in February 1999, basically due to the important growth of complementary net equity. Consequently, capital integration by credit risk in terms of assets weighted by risk according to the Basel criterion increased to 17.2%.
