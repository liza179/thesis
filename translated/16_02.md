1. Summary¹
• Throughout February, the Central Bank continued acting to make monetary aggregates compatible with a downward trajectory of the inflation rate. The sterilization policy implemented in the month moderated the year-over-year variation of the monetary base, which stood at 25%. This action by the Central Bank was favored by the behavior registered in bank reserves throughout the three-month period –from December to February– of integration of the Minimum Cash regime. With the beginning of a new Minimum Cash position, a recomposition of bank reserves is expected. This would motivate a transitory acceleration in the monetary base, which is consistent with the marked decrease in its growth rate that will take place this year.

• Among the remaining monetary aggregates, reductions in the growth rate were also observed. In particular, transactional money from the private sector (Private M2) again reduced its expansion speed (-1.2 p.p.), showing a year-over-year variation of 28.2%.

• Fixed-term deposits from the private sector showed a monthly growth of 1.5% and a year-over-year variation around 50%. When distinguishing by amount bracket, a moderation is observed in the growing trend of deposits of less than $1 million, together with a decrease in placements of the wholesale segment. The lower dynamism of fixed-term deposits of more than $1 million would be associated, partially, with the sustained demand for LEBAC by investors that are not financial entities.

• Loans in pesos to the private sector showed a decrease of 0.7% ($5,700 million) and continued decelerating their year-over-year growth rate, which went from 36.7% in January to 35% in February. The decrease registered in the month was explained fundamentally by the behavior of loans instrumented through documents, while the remaining lines presented more limited variations.

• In a context of lower dynamism of loans in the private sector, the liquidity ratio of financial entities in local currency grew again for the third consecutive month, reaching 38.6%. Within the framework of the three-month minimum cash position, a change was observed in the composition of liquidity, with greater holdings of LEBAC by financial entities and, to a lesser extent, a greater balance of net repos and cash in banks. These increases were partially offset by a considerable fall in the current account of entities at the Central Bank, which reached one of the lowest levels in recent years.

• Reinforcing its commitment to inflation moderation, the Central Bank increased the cutoff interest rate in its weekly LEBAC auctions. In this way, by the end of February the interest rates of LEBAC were located at 31.2% for the shortest term (35 days) and 28.6% for the security awarded with the greatest maturity (255 days). This bias in monetary policy continued during the first auction in March, in which the Central Bank promoted interest rate increases of up to 6 p.p. In the same direction, the Central Bank adjusted the interest rate corridor on February 29, placing the interest rates of passive repos of 1 and 7 days at 25% and 26%, and that of active repos at 34% and 35%, for the same terms. Similarly with the behavior of LEBAC rates, the Central Bank again raised repo rates towards the beginning of March by 3 p.p for passive repos and 4 p.p for active ones.

• International reserves ended at a level close to US$29,000 million, registering a decrease throughout the month explained mainly by the fall in holdings of financial entities at the Central Bank that were used to meet the demand of their clients. Part of these holdings corresponded to anticipated income from clients registered during the month of December and
settled in the foreign exchange market during the month of February.

In this report, "amounts granted" or "new loans" are understood as loans (new and renewals) arranged in a period. In contrast, the variation in balance is composed of loans arranged, minus amortizations and cancellations of the period.

Feb-11 Feb-12 Feb-13 Feb-14 Feb-15 Feb-16 In effect, the interest rate paid by private entities for fixed-term deposits of up to $100 thousand and up to 35 days of term averaged 24%, registering a decrease of 0.7 p.p. compared to January. The decline was recorded in the first half of the month, showing stable behavior in the second part of February. For its part, the BADLAR – interest rate for fixed-term deposits of $1 million or more, of 30-35 days of term – of private banks showed a decrease of 0.2 p.p. with respect to the previous month and stood at 26.1% (see Chart 5.5). Likewise, in the second part of the month, the wholesale rate exhibited relatively stable evolution. It should be noted that the increases on the last day of February in the cut rates of the securities auctioned weekly by the BCRA and the interest rates of its repo operations did not manage to be reflected in the passive rates of that month, but rather impacted fully in March.

In the foreign currency segment, the interest rates paid for fixed-term deposits showed decreases compared to January. Following the normalization of the foreign exchange market in December, and the reductions in the cut rates of LEBAC in dollars, the interest rates for fixed-term deposits began to show a downward trend in the course of 2016. Thus, the rate corresponding to placements of deposits of up to US$100 thousand decreased in February by 0.7 p.p. for the 30 to 44 days segment, while the 45 to 59 days deposits showed decreases of 0.3 p.p., and 0.9 p.p. decline for those of 60 days or more (see Chart 5.6).

**Active Interest Rates¹**

The active interest rates showed, in general terms, declines throughout the month. With regard to the lines destined to finance families, the monthly average of the interest rate for personal loans stood at 42%, declining 1.1 p.p. compared to January. Meanwhile, the interest rate corresponding to pledged credit loans averaged 30.5% in February, reflecting an increase of 1.5 p.p. (see Chart 5.7).

With regard to the lines mostly for commercial purposes, the interest rate applied to current account overdrafts declined 0.9 p.p. and stood at 33.6%. The behavior of the interest rate for this latter line evolved in consonance with short-term interest rates, reflecting the improved liquidity conditions of entities in the month. In particular, the interest rate applied to advances to companies of more than $10 million and up to 7 days of term reached 27.6%, showing a decline of 1.7 p.p. compared to January (see Chart 5.8).
For its part, the interest rate on discounted documents fell 1.4 percentage points and stood at 27.8%, in line with the movement of short-term rates. In the case of documents with sole signature, the interest rate

International Reserves of the BCRA averaged 31.7%, standing 1.8 percentage points below that observed the previous month.

6. International Reserves and Foreign Exchange Market¹

In a context of greater demand in the foreign exchange market, the reference exchange rate of the peso/US dollar ended at 15.58 in February, increasing 12.1% with respect to the January closing. Since the exchange rate unification, the Central Bank allowed the market to freely establish the parity at which foreign currency buying and selling transactions were operated in the country, and made only sporadic interventions in the last days of the month, within the framework of its managed floating exchange rate scheme.

International reserves ended at a level close to US$28,400 million (see Chart 6.1), registering a decline throughout the month explained mostly by the fall in holdings of financial entities at the Central Bank that were used to meet their customers' demand. Part of these holdings corresponded to anticipated income from customers recorded during the month of December and settled in the foreign exchange market during the month of February.

7. Collective Investment Instruments

Common Investment Funds

In February, the net worth of Common Investment Funds (FCI), denominated in pesos and in foreign currency, grew $10,350 million (5%), standing at the close of the month at $217,010 million.

The increase was explained fundamentally by the behavior recorded in the net worth of Fixed Income funds in pesos that grew $11,150 million (10%). This increase concentrated mainly in the second half of February and was driven both by the subscription of fund shares and by the accumulated yield in the month. For their part, Mixed Income funds showed growth of $2,780 million in the month (6.8%), while Variable Income funds increased $1,070 million (16%) driven by good performance in the local stock market. This behavior was partly offset by Money Market funds that presented declines of $4,960 million (-11.2%) explained by the redemption of fund shares (see Chart 7.1).

Regarding estimated profitability, during

¹ The interest rates referred to in this section are annual nominal rates and do not include evaluation and granting expenses nor other expenditures (insurance, for example) that are considered in the total financial cost of loans.
Monthly average of amount issued in the year February stood out the return of variable income funds that yielded a monthly return of around 15.6%. Likewise, mixed income funds registered a positive return of 6.8% and fixed income funds verified gains of 4.8%. Finally, Money Market funds gained 1.5% in the month (see Chart 7.2).

Regarding the foreign currency segment, the assets of the FCI were reduced by US$5 million to reach US$251 million.

## Financial Trusts11

In February, the issuances of financial trusts (FF) totaled around $2,290 million through 16 placements, showing a decrease of 14% with respect to the volume traded in January. Considering the 12-month moving average of the amount issued by FF (excluding FF from the public sector and other infrastructure-related ones) not linked to the financing of infrastructure works, an acceleration in the rate of year-over-year growth has been observed since early 2015. In effect, the year-over-year change went from being in negative territory in April of last year to 27.9% in February of this year (see Chart 7.3).

Among the settlors, the "Mutuals, cooperatives and non-bank credit card issuers and other providers of financial services" stood out, which placed $1,270 million, concentrating more than half of the total issued in the month and reflecting an increase of 52% with respect to the previous month (see Chart 7.4). For their part, retail stores placed around $800 million, practically half of what was placed in January. In the case of financial entities, a single placement of $89 million was registered, being the lowest level of the last ten months. The remainder corresponded to a company linked to agricultural activity and another belonging to the gas and oil industry, which securitized, respectively, commercial credits and leasing contracts.

The cut-off interest rate (amount-weighted average) of senior securities —in pesos and with duration of less than 12 months— with variable return was placed at 31.9%, evidencing a decrease of 1.1 p.p. with respect to the previous month. Meanwhile, no fixed-rate operations were registered.

## 8. Principal Measures of Policy of Other Central Banks

During February the volatility of international financial markets (see Chart 8.1), which began in December following the decision of the Federal Reserve (FED) to increase its reference interest rate, continued to be the main characteristic of the month.

Taking into account this international scenario, different members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the FED gave signals that future increases in the reference interest rate, the federal funds rate (TFF), would be gradual and

*The FED does not follow an inflation target regime; it has a mandate by which it must promote the objectives of "maximum" level of employment, moderate long-term interest rates and stable prices. Regarding the latter, at the FOMC meeting on January 25, 2012, an objective of an annual variation of 2% for Personal Consumption Expenditures in the long term was set.

---

The decisions would take into account the international and local economic situation. Indeed, it should be recalled that in the press release from its January meeting the FOMC stated that it was closely following the evolution of world economic and financial conditions, to estimate the possible consequences that this volatility could have on the labor market and on U.S. inflation.

Furthermore, in the minutes released on February 17, it is detailed that some FOMC members expressed their concern regarding the lack of dynamism in domestic consumption and the low level of inflation (see Chart 8.2). In this context, market expectations do not anticipate new increases in the Federal Funds Rate until, at least, the last quarter of the year.

For its part, the monetary authorities of England did not modify the bias of their monetary policy. Indeed, on February 4 the Bank of England (BoE), in a unanimous vote, maintained its monetary policy interest rate (the Bank Rate) at 0.5% (see Chart 8.3). Along with this, market projections do not expect an increase in the Bank Rate before the end of 2016, or even early 2017. Towards the end of the month, on February 22, the pound sterling suffered its largest depreciation in a single day since October 2009 (1.8%), amid support for a withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union by many members of Prime Minister Cameron's cabinet, a withdrawal that will be put to a vote by citizens in a referendum that will take place in June of this year.

---

In the case of the European Central Bank (ECB), in February the Governing Council (GC) did not meet, so its monetary policy interest rate remains at 0.05%, its interest rate corridor at 0.3% for the credit facility interest rate and at -0.2% for the deposit facility interest rate (see Chart 8.4). Along with this, it is expected that it will probably take new expansionary measures at its meeting on March 10, as emerges from the minutes recently published by the ECB. Among the possible measures, the ECB could bring the deposit facility interest rate to even more negative values, following the measures taken in this regard recently by the monetary authorities of Japan and Sweden.

Precisely, the Central Bank of Sweden (Riksbank) decided at its meeting on February 10 to reduce its monetary policy interest rate (the Repo Rate) by 0.15 p.p. to -0.5%, while maintaining the width of the interest rate corridor that stands at -1.25% (credit facility
0 deposit) and 0.25% (credit facility, see Graph 8.5). The Riksbank made this decision in a context in which it reduced its inflation projection for 2016 (with

Jan-06 Jan-07 Jan-08 Jan-09 Jan-10 Jan-11 Jan-12 Jan-13 Jan-14 Jan-15 Jan-16 respect to the previous projection from mid-December) to practically half, 0.7%, outside the inflation target (2% ± 1 p.p.). However, following the Riksbank meeting, the January inflation data of 0.7% y.o.y. became known, which was surprising as it was higher than expected by market expectations (0.5%), and 0.65 p.p. higher than December.

For its part, among emerging countries, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) continued injecting liquidity throughout the month in an extraordinary manner (with daily operations, instead of weekly) seeking to satisfy the greater seasonal liquidity demand (linked to the Chinese New Year), and attempting to compensate for the monetary contraction resulting from its intervention in the foreign exchange market, with which it seeks to avoid a greater depreciation of the yuan.

Finally, during the period under analysis, the Monetary Policy Committee (COPOM) of the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) did not meet, so the target for the Selic rate remains at 14.25%. In addition, according to the market expectations survey -Focus- conducted by the BCB, no changes are expected in the March 4 meeting regarding the Selic objective. This decision would be made in a context where the latest January inflation data (10.7%) is the highest since late 2003. In addition, recession signals continue. In fact, also according to Focus, a contraction of the Brazilian economy of 3.4% is expected in 2016.
