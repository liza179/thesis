1. Summary
# Translation to English

• Private sector deposits, both sight and time deposits, increased in May. Fixed-term placements continued to grow, driven mainly by the segment of less than $1 million, which showed the largest increase in recent years (4.3%). The corresponding wholesale stratum maintained its balance relatively stable, in a period characterized by the high liquidity demand of companies to face tax payment deadlines.

• As is customary, the greater liquidity needs of companies had as a correlate the increase in loans granted through overdrafts in current accounts. This line was the one that drove the growth of the balance of loans in pesos to the private sector during May. Overall, financing in pesos to the private sector grew 1% ($4,980 million) and reached growth of 26.9% year-over-year.

• The Central Bank continues to stimulate productive credit through the Bicentennial Productive Financing Program (PFPB) and the Line of Credit for Productive Investment (LCIP). Within the framework of the PFPB, it continued disbursing long-term funds for investment at a fixed total financial cost in pesos. Thus, the total resources disbursed since the beginning of the program amounts to $6,327 million, around 80% of what was allocated. Regarding the LCIP, it arranged that also during the month of June financial entities may apply up to 10% of the quota for the first semester of 2014 to the discount of deferred payment checks from MSMEs (with a total limit of 40%), but without the possibility of transferring what was not applied in May to the following month. According to the preliminary information available, through April, 28 of the 31 entities included in the LCIP agreed on loans complying with 41% of their established target for the first semester of 2014 on an aggregate basis.

• An increase in liquidity in local currency was observed (sum of cash, current account at the Central Bank, net transfers with this institution and holdings of LEBAC and NOBAC), which reached a level equivalent to 36.6% of the total deposits in pesos, 0.8 p.p. above April, explained mainly through greater holdings of LEBAC and NOBAC.

• In May the Central Bank reduced 1 p.p. the interest rates it pays for the securities it places each week in the primary market. The reduction, carried out at the beginning of the month, was across all maturities of the yield curve. The interest rates of LEBACs auctioned at a predetermined value –at maturities of 85 days and 105 days– were positioned at 26.7% and 26.9% respectively.

• Within this framework, the interest rates paid by financial entities for their fixed-term deposits declined, returning to the levels observed at the end of January. In particular, in the wholesale segment, the BADLAR of private banks –interest rate for fixed-term deposits of $1 million and more, of 30-35 days maturity– averaged 24.7%, declining 1.6 p.p. during the month. For its part, the monthly average of the interest rate paid by private entities for fixed-term deposits of up to $100 thousand up to 35 days was positioned at 21.2%, 0.4 p.p. below April.

• In general, the interest rates applied on loans in pesos to the private sector continued to decline, a movement observed since the second half of April. Among commercial lines, the interest rates applied on financing through documents were those that led the decrease. The monthly average of the interest rate applied on document discounts was positioned at 27.8%, declining 1.8 p.p. during the month. Among the longer-term lines, the one corresponding to personal loans declined 1.6 p.p., averaging 44.5%; while the interest rate on pawn loans decreased 2.1 p.p., positioning itself at 25.4%.

• At the beginning of June the Central Bank adopted a series of regulatory modifications aimed at expand-
# Translation to English

Direct credit under more favorable conditions for families. In the first place, it adopted a system of reference interest rates for loans to individuals, basically personal and pledged loans, with the purpose of limiting the cost of credit for the most vulnerable segments of the population. In turn, it established that financial entities must have prior authorization to apply increases to the cost of basic financial products and services. Also, with the aim of avoiding distortions, it provided that the total financial cost be reported as annual nominal rate, instead of annual effective rate. Finally, taking into account the development of financing that non-financial credit providers grant to their clients, particularly in localities that lack infrastructure for the provision of services by financial entities, it established a regulation for credit assistance to these lenders (mutuals, cooperatives and non-financial issuers of credit or purchase cards, among others).

The liquidity of financial entities (sum of cash in banks, the current account of entities at the Central Bank, net repos with such entity and the holding of LEBACs and NOBACs) increased during May for the fourth consecutive month, representing on average 36.6% of total deposits in pesos. This ratio was 0.8 p.p. higher than that of April (see Graph 3.1). Among its components, an increase was observed in the holding of LEBACs and NOBACs and a decrease in the proportion of cash in banks and repos with the Central Bank. Meanwhile, the current account at the Central Bank in relation to deposits remained stable, so that the month's surplus under the minimum cash regime was equivalent to 0.3% of the total deposits in pesos (see Graph 3.2).

For its part, in the foreign currency segment, liquidity decreased, standing at 103.6% of total deposits in dollars (9.2 p.p. lower than the April ratio). This reduction is explained by the decrease in the proportion of current accounts in dollars of entities at the Central Bank.

**4. Loans¹⁴**

In May, loans in pesos to the private sector exhibited growth of 1% ($4,980 million), after two months of remaining practically stable. Thus, in the last twelve months they accumulated an increase of 26.9%. Advances led the month's growth, followed by financing with credit cards (see Graph 4.1).

The lines designed mainly to finance commercial activities presented heterogeneous behaviors. On one hand, advances grew at a good pace, in a period when companies usually increase their demand for funds in order to meet their tax obligations. The increase recorded in the month was 3.6% ($2,220 million) and the year-on-year variation stood at 22.3%, 3.2 p.p. more than in April (see Graph 4.2).

On the other hand, financing implemented through documents experienced a decrease of 1.6% ($1,700 million), and its year-on-year variation reached 27.5%. The remaining commercial financing,

 7. Collective Investment Instruments

 Mutual Investment Funds

 In May the assets of Mutual Investment Funds (FCI)
 in pesos and in foreign currency continued
 growing, despite the decline recorded mid-month
 in Money Market funds as a consequence of the
 use of resources to face tax payment maturities.
Source: BCRA

The equity of Investment Fund Trusts (FCI) grew $3,990 million compared to the previous month and was located at $92,580 million. The monthly increase was driven by the peso-denominated segment, highlighting the performance of fixed income funds which verified an increase of $2,640 million (6.4%), followed by mixed income funds with an increase of $1,400 million (9.3%) and funds that invest most of their portfolio in variable income assets where a growth of $630 million (23.3%) was observed. Partially offsetting this behavior were Money Market funds which fell $850 million (3.1%), driven by the redemption of fund shares in the middle of the month.

*thousands of millions of $ (monthly variation of stock at month end) millions of $*

In the case of variable income and mixed income funds, the variation in the balance was driven by the good performance recorded by quotations on the local market and, to a lesser extent, by the increase in the quantity of fund shares. Variable income funds in pesos continued to be the best performers in terms of profitability and recorded a monthly return of 13.5%, followed by mixed income funds in pesos which had a monthly return of 4.5%. For their part, in fixed income funds the increase was due to the greater quantity of fund shares and to a lesser extent to the increase in profitability. The monthly return of fixed income funds was placed at 3.1%.

Finally, with respect to the foreign currency segment, the equity of FCIs grew US$20 million, reaching US$307 million. The behavior was driven equally by mixed income funds and fixed income funds.

## Financial Trusts⁹

In May, Financial Trusts (FF) issuances totaled around $1,555 million, 23.5% less than the previous month. The decline is explained by the lower average amount per placement (it went from $113 million to $86 million), since the quantity of operations carried out in the month remained at 18 (see Chart 7.3). Among the month's issuances, a trust was registered that has the purpose of developing real estate ventures in the cities of Santa Fe and Paraná. The contributions from subscribers of fiduciary titles ($2.2 million) will be destined to the acquisition of land and construction of the properties, for the subsequent delivery of the resulting units to the holders of participation certificates (CPs). It should be noted that in November 2013, the CNV had issued a resolution establishing that real estate financial trusts¹⁰ could issue CPs that grant the right to acquire a functional unit or equivalent, with the consequent negotiation of CPs in the secondary market. The intention of the measure was to expand investor access beyond the geographic scope of construction project developers, since most real estate trusts have been structured privately.

 Regarding the fiduciaries, retail commerce concentrated more than half of the amount issued in the month, securitizing loans linked to consumption. In effect, they placed $855 million, showing an increase of 58% compared to April. In this way, they reached the largest amount since the second semester of 2013. For their part, financial entities placed close to $360 million, approximately half that of April, while "Mutual associations,

 As in the previous month, during May there were no
 major changes recorded in the orientation of monetary
 policy in the main advanced and emerging countries. In
 general, monetary authorities kept the direction of their
 respective policies unchanged, with expectations
 regarding future measures gaining importance. In this
 aspect, the announcements made by the European
 Chart 8.1 Central Bank stood out before the publication of this
 report, during the first few days of June.

 during the first few days of June.

 On this occasion the ECB announced a package of
 measures to conduct a more expansive monetary policy
 and encourage credit toward the real economy. First, it
 reduced its monetary policy interest rate to 0.15%, the
 rate of its credit facility to 0.4% and that of its deposit
 facility to -0.1%, placing it in negative territory for the
 first time in its history (see Chart 8.1). Likewise, the
 ECB implemented complementary measures that include
 auctions of Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing
**Monetary Report | May 2014 | BCRA | 13**

Operations (TLTROs), through which it would grant liquidity to financial entities as long as they increase the stock of loans to the non-financial private sector (SPNF) of the eurozone.

Likewise, it announced the intensification of preparatory work related to the direct purchase of asset-backed securities (loans whose underlying asset are credits to the SPNF) and the extension of its liquidity management policy (at fixed rate and under full allotment) until December 2016.

**Chart 8.2**

On the other hand, although the Federal Reserve of the United States (FED) did not have a meeting scheduled until June, the markets were attentive to the publication of some indicators. Among them, the second estimate of GDP corresponding to the first quarter of 2014 stood out, which was revised downward, from 0.1% (annualized quarterly rate) to -1%, as a consequence of a revision in the (dis)accumulation of inventories (driven by climatic factors). Nevertheless, several inflation indicators improved during the last period, approaching the FED's target (2%). Among them, the personal consumption expenditures deflator (PCE) increased 1.6% y.o.y. in April, 0.5 p.p. above March, while core PCE increased 1.4% y.o.y., 0.2 p.p. higher than the previous month.

* The FED does not follow an inflation targeting regime; it has a mandate by which it must promote the objectives of "maximum" level of employment, moderate long-term interest rates and stable prices. Regarding the latter, at the FOMC meeting on January 25, 2012, a target of an annual variation of 2% was set for Personal Consumption Expenditures in the long term.

For its part, among Latin American countries, the Central Bank of the Republic of Colombia increased its monetary policy rate by 0.25 p.p. to 3.75%, giving continuity to its policy that proposes a gradual adjustment to reduce the need for any sharp adjustments in the future. However, the rest of the central banks that held meetings in May (Brazil, Chile and Peru) maintained their respective reference interest rates, awaiting the effects of previously implemented measures. Within this framework, the case of the Central Bank of Brazil stands out, which, faced with a worse macroeconomic scenario, and in line with what the markets expected, maintained its SELIC rate target at 11%, after nine consecutive increases (see Chart 8.3). In effect, economic activity would be slowing down, driven, in part, by worse performance of industrial production. Likewise, inflation continued to grow (0.1 p.p. to 6.3%) and would be approaching the upper limit of its inflation target (2.5%-6.5%).

10. Recent Regulatory Changes

At the beginning of June, the Central Bank adopted a series of regulatory modifications aimed at expanding credit under more favorable conditions for families, in a context of high liquidity levels of financial entities, strong potential for growth in terms of the credit/GDP ratio, and a credit market with reduced delinquency levels in relation to international standards.

With the purpose of limiting credit costs for the most vulnerable population segments, and within the framework of the powers granted by its Charter, the Central Bank established reference interest rates for financing in pesos to individuals that are granted, basically, through personal loans and secured loans¹¹ (Communication "A" 5590).

The interest rates for such financing may not exceed the product between the interest rate of LEBACs with maturity closest to 90 days (from the second month immediately prior to the disbursement of the financing) and a coefficient that depends on the type of loan and the group¹² to which each financial entity belongs, located between 1.25 and 2. The aforementioned coefficient is higher for smaller financial entities, since, for reasons of scale, they operate with higher cost of funds, administrative expenses, and delinquency in their credit portfolio. In turn, within each group it is lower for secured loans on motor vehicles than for the rest of the financing included. The Central Bank will publish monthly the reference interest rate for Group I and Group II entities applicable to each type of loan (secured loans for motor vehicles, portfolio purchases and remaining financing).

Financial entities that apply interest rates above the reference interest rates reported by the Central Bank will have to face an increase in the requirement for Minimum Cash in pesos. However, this increase may be reversed depending on the loans they grant to SMEs under the conditions provided in the LCIP, insofar as they are not charged as an application of that line. For informational purposes, with this regulatory change the Central Bank would be regulating a large part of new loans granted to individuals.

¹¹ Covers all financing in pesos granted to individuals with the exception of those instrumentalized as overdrafts, credit card financing, and mortgage loans on housing.
¹² Entities will be divided between Group I (financial agents of the national, provincial, or municipal state and/or other entities that participate with at least 1% of the total deposits of the non-financial private sector) and Group II (the remaining entities).

Monetary Report | May 2014 | BCRA | 15
On the other hand, in its protective role regarding the rights of users of financial services, and within the framework of regulations on "Protection of users of financial services", through Communication "A" 5591, the Central Bank specified which financial services are considered basic (maintenance of savings accounts, withdrawals at automated teller machines, replacement of debit cards and additional services linked to social security deposit accounts, among others) and resolved that both financial entities and non-financial companies that issue credit cards must request authorization from it in order to make increases in the commissions of those financial services.

In turn, through Communication "A" 5592, in order to improve disclosure regarding interest rates and total financial cost (CFT) in credit operations and with the purpose of avoiding undesired distortions in the information to be published, it was established that the total financial cost of credit operations be expressed as nominal annual rate (instead of effective annual rate). The modification is due to the fact that the use of effective annual rate assumes monthly capitalization of accrued interest on each credit and also on concepts computable in the CFT (such as VAT and insurance), which does not align with the fact that these interests are charged monthly, since 98% of debtors are in normal standing. Likewise, the disclosure of CFT must differentiate the tax burden of the loan.

Finally, through Communication "A" 5593, a regulation was established for access to financing for non-financial credit providers, understood as those legal entities that, without being financial entities supervised by the Central Bank, offer credit to individuals. This concept includes mutual associations, cooperatives and non-financial issuers of credit or purchase cards, among other lenders.

Taking into account the development of financing that non-financial credit providers grant to their customers, particularly in localities that lack infrastructure for the provision of services by financial entities, the creation of two registries for this type of lenders was established: the "registry of non-financial companies that issue credit and/or purchase cards" and the "registry of other non-financial credit providers". Registration in these registries will be a requirement to access financing from financial entities. In turn, these companies must provide information to the Central Bank regarding the financing they provide to users of financial services. As a result of this requirement, credit borrowers in regular compliance will benefit from access to financial products and services on more favorable terms as a consequence of the registration of their good credit behavior.
