Monetary Report | November 2010 | BCRA | 2 1. Summary
• In November, monetary aggregates in pesos continued their recovery path initiated in the first quarter of this year. Total means of payment (M2) reached an average balance of $233,130 million, registering a monthly increase of 1.6% (28.8% y.o.y.). As in the previous month, the increase shown by loans to the private sector was the main explanatory factor of the variation in total M2 in November. In line with previous months, the good performance of credit continued to promote high secondary money creation, which in the last two months exceeded the foreign currency purchases carried out by the Central Bank in the market as the main factor of monetary growth. For its part, the broad monetary aggregate (M3) which includes currency in circulation and the total deposits of the private and public sectors, showed an increase of 2.1%, accumulating in the last 12 months an increase of 35.5%, due to the good performance of time deposits from both the private and public sectors.

• Time deposits registered increases, mainly in the wholesale segment (placements of more than $1 million), while retail segment deposits also grew. However, it is likely that in the coming weeks time placements (especially wholesale) will reduce their expansion rate, as a consequence of the high seasonal liquidity demand of companies, which among other factors is associated with the payment of the half-year bonus.

• The Central Bank of the Argentine Republic implemented a new means of payment called Cancelatory Check, which aims to reduce the use of cash and, in this way, increase security in banking operations. Cancelatory Checks can be issued in pesos or in United States dollars, with the latter being usable only in real estate purchase operations. At the end of November, Cancelatory Checks in local currency reached $8 million and those issued in foreign currency amounted to u$s5 million. It should be noted that within the definition of means of payment (M2), Cancelatory Checks in pesos are included, so that the substitution of cash use for these new instruments does not alter its value, but only changes its composition.

• In November, small declines were recorded in the cut-off interest rates of LEBACs, partially reversed at the end of the month. It is worth noting that in the last November auction, instruments of 1 and 2 months maturity were adjudicated again. With respect to NOBACs, the total of the month's adjudications constitutes a record amount and the maturities of the securities placed extended from 6 to 22 months, with the largest adjudications being made through securities with 180-day maturities. The margins paid on the BADLAR of Private Banks were lower for longer maturities, finding a decline of 0.15 p.p. in the securities placed at one year. The Central Bank's repo interest rates remained at the same levels as October. Passive repo rates were positioned at 9% and 9.5% for 1 and 7 days, respectively, while active repo interest rates of 1 and 7 days were at 11% and 11.5%, respectively.

• Interest rates in the interbank market (call) averaged 9.4%, with a decline of 0.7 p.p. compared to October, while the interest rate in the repo market between financial entities (excluding the Central Bank) for 1 business day was 9.4%, 0.8 p.p. less than in October. The average interest rate paid by private financial entities for peso deposits of up to 35 days and exceeding $1 million (BADLAR) was positioned at 10.8%, increasing 0.1 p.p. during the month. For its part, the monthly average of the interest rate paid in the retail segment (up to $100 thousand) remained at 9.1%. The rates of
interest rates charged by the most representative commercial loans showed disparate behaviors. On one hand, the average monthly interest rate of the total advances increased 0.6 p.p. in the month, standing at 19.2%. For their part, the average monthly interest rates of discounted documents registered a slight increase (0.1 p.p.), standing at 13.4%. On the contrary, the interest rate charged for financing with promissory notes registered a decrease of 0.4 p.p., standing at 14.7% at the end of November.

• Loans in pesos to the private sector presented in November an increase in their monthly average of 3.2% ($4,960 million), with a year-on-year variation of 33.1%, 2.4 p.p. above that recorded the previous month. Although the monthly growth was somewhat lower than that of the previous month, they continued to maintain high dynamism, with similar contributions from both the lines intended for commercial activity and those intended for consumption, with both segments growing around 3.3% in the month.

• Within the framework of the Bicentennial Productive Financing Program (PFPB), which aims at the granting of long-term funds to financial entities in order to improve the supply of credit for investment and productive activity with a fixed total financial cost in pesos, the second fund auction was conducted. On this occasion, the total amount auctioned amounted to $350 million and resources of $340 million were awarded. The interest rate to be paid by each financial entity will be 9% nominal annual on the awarded funds, while the total financial cost for the respective borrowers will be up to 9.9% nominal annual.

 Monetary Report | November 2010 | BCRA | 3 2. Monetary Aggregates1

 In November, monetary aggregates continued their recovery path. In particular, total means of payment (M2) reached an average balance of $233,130 million, registering a monthly increase
Chart 2.1 of 1.6% (28.8% y.o.y.; see Chart 2.1). For its part, the broad monetary aggregate (M3) which includes currency in circulation and the total deposits of the private and public sectors, showed an increase of 2.1%, accumulating in the last 12 months an increase of 35.5%, due to the good performance of time deposits from both the private sector and the public sector.

 Sight Deposits Like last month, the increase shown by loans to the private sector turned out to be the main factor explaining the variation of total M2 in November (see Chart 2.2). In line with previous months, the good performance of credit continues to promote high secondary money creation (see Loans section), which in the last two months exceeds the foreign exchange purchases made by the Central Bank in the market as the main factor of monetary growth, which became the second most important factor of monetary creation. Meanwhile, the growth exhibited by fixed-term placements generated a contraction that partially offset the aforementioned expansionary effects.

Loans in pesos to the private sector showed in November an increase in their monthly average of 3.2% ($4,960 million; see Chart 4.1), with a year-on-year variation of 33.1%, 2.4 percentage points above that registered the previous month. Although the monthly growth was somewhat lower than that of the previous month, they continued to maintain high dynamism, with similar contributions from both lines destined to commercial activity and those destined mainly to consumption, with both segments growing around 3.3% in the month.

Within loans destined mainly to commercial activity, the financings implemented through documents stood out, which continued with the dynamism they have been showing since July, registering an increase of 4% in the month ($1,235 million). For their part, advances on current account remained at October levels, a month in which they presented strong growth after several months of relative stability. In fact, in November they registered an increase of just 0.3% ($55 million; see Chart 4.2).

For their part, credit directed mainly to consumption decelerated its expansion pace compared to October. After the additional boost from higher consumption associated with Mother's Day, financing with credit cards showed a softening in its expansion pace, growing 2.4% ($590 million), a rate similar to that of September. Meanwhile, personal loans continued to grow as in the previous months, registering an increase of 4% in November ($1,545 million).

Credits with real guarantees also grew at a rate similar to the previous month, increasing 2.7% ($775 million). Chattel mortgage loans continued to grow at high rates, in a context of great dynamism in automobile sales. Although a seasonal decline began to be observed in registration levels, sales continue to be firm. In this scenario, chattel mortgage loans registered growth of 3.9% in the month ($340 million; see Chart 4.3). For their part, mortgage loans continued to accelerate their expansion pace and doubled the growth rate that had been observed during the third quarter, evidencing an increase of 2.1% in the month ($435 million).

Finally, loans in foreign currency to the private sector showed an acceleration in their growth pace, expanding 4.7% (u$s 310 million) in the month. In this way, the average balance of this type of loans was located in November at around $6,900 million, of which 86% corresponded to financings implemented through documents (see Chart 4.4).

 that the average maturity of what was traded was significantly
 higher than the previous month, with contracts

Stocks

Until early November, widespread increases continued (initiated in September) of the indices of the stock markets most relevant to the Argentine economy. During the first week, with the publication of positive indicators regarding the evolution of the U.S. economy and the announcement of the second phase of Quantitative Easing measures, the stock market indices continued to grow. However, from the second week onwards, these indices were

Chart 7.1 affected by the growing tension due to the crisis in Ireland and concern about possible contagion to other European economies (Spain and Portugal), uncertainty about China's monetary policy, and finally, tension over the escalation of the conflict between North and South Korea.

 by the IGBVL (Peru) with 7.2%, the IPC (Mexico) with 2.3% and
 the IGPA (Chile) which increased 0.6%. Among these, it should
 be noted that the Chilean peso was the only currency to
 appreciate (0.4%), while the Argentine peso depreciated 0.8%,
 and both the Peruvian sol and the Mexican peso did so by 1.2%.

 In November, the MERVAL index (Argentina) measured
 in local currency continued with the upward trend that
 had begun at the end of August, totaling a growth of 40%
 during the last three months, closing the month at 3,261
 points (maximum historical value, and measured in dollars
 since October 1997). This is due in part to the good climate
 in the local financial markets following the success of the
 second debt swap and progress towards an agreement with the

 Monetary Report | November 2010 | BCRA | 12 Paris Club. In the last 12 months the MERVAL has accumulated
 a gain of 51.8%.

 In a context of improvement in Argentine stock prices,
 the historical volatility of the MERVAL -22 trading days-,
 in annualized terms and measured in dollars, increased 17.5
 p.p. in November, to end at 34.4%. In this framework, the
 expected volatility of S&P500 (measured by the VIX) on
 average in October was 20%, with no major changes (-0.4 p.p.)
 compared to the previous month.

 For its part, the daily average trading volume at the Buenos
 Aires Stock Exchange was $106.5 million, the largest amount
 traded in the last 2.5 years.

 Public Securities

 During November there was a slight decline in both the
 quotations of public securities and in the volume of trading
 in this market, linked largely to profit taking and holidays in
 the local and North American markets. In any case, in the last
 days of the month there was an increase associated with
 expectations generated by the start of negotiations

 towards an agreement to settle the debt with the Paris Club.

In November, the trading volume of public securities (daily average) in the local market reached $1,150 million, with a reduction of $325 million compared to October, but still above the average for the last 12 months ($1,050 million). With respect to November 2009, the amount traded increased by $220 million.

Monetary Report | November 2010 | BCRA | 13 Private Securities

During November in the private debt market, twelve placements of negotiable obligations (ONs) were registered, of which half were carried out in local currency, for a total amount of $180 million, and the remaining six (two of them SME ONs) in foreign currency for a total of u$s410 million. The total amount placed during the month amounts to $1,800 million, becoming the third month with the highest volume of debt issuances in the last 3 and a half years (see Graph 7.3). Among the sectors financed through this means, Food and Electric Power stand out with 44% and 36% of monthly participation respectively. So far this year, the Fuel and Transportation categories had been dominating the private securities market (see Graph 7.4) although the latter was superseded by Electric Power thanks to the significant placements of the month.

# Monetary Report | November 2010 | BCRA | 14

Arcor S.A.I.C. issued debt for a total of US$200 million to mature within 7 years. This instrument will pay a fixed interest rate of 7.25% each semester.

Emgasud S.A. (Southeastern Gas Company) placed two ONs for a total of US$157 million. Both placements will mature in September 2017 and will carry out capital amortization quarterly. The Class II ONs, which reached the amount of US$80 million, had the objective of complete cancellation of the Class I ONs that were in circulation and would be delivered in exchange (US$82 million at the time of issuance of the second series). These new obligations will pay a monthly interest of 14% during the first 17 months and then, quarterly, an interest of 11%. For their part, the Class III ONs, which amount to US$77 million, will be intended mainly for the construction, installation and startup of the Rawson I and Rawson II wind farms. These obligations will pay monthly interest of 11% during the first 17 months and quarterly from March 2012 onwards.

Banco Supervielle S.A. placed debt for a total of US$50 million to mature in November 2017. This issuance will pay a fixed interest rate of 11.375% each semester.

Within the 2 SME ONs are Rural Ceres II and InsuAgro I. The first, from the company of the same name dedicated to the commercialization of cereals and oilseeds, amounts to US$2 million with maturity within 25 months. Each quarter, it will pay an interest of 7.25% and will amortize 12.5% of the total capital. The second instrument, whose amount is US$1.5 million, belongs to the company of the same name intended for the commercialization of agrochemical products. This ON will be in effect for 9 months and will pay a fixed interest rate of 8% during the last three months. In turn, capital amortization will also take place during those same periods with installments equivalent to 25%, 35% and 40% respectively.

## Investment Funds

Investment Funds (FCIs), in pesos and in foreign currency, reached in November a total net worth of $19,500 million, totaling a monthly increase of 3.2%. During the month, an important reclassification of FCIs was carried out that were previously in foreign currency, and as of November they are part of the FCIs denominated in pesos.

4 The net worth of two equity funds in dollars became part of funds in pesos.

# Monetary Report | November 2010 | BCRA | 15

On one hand, FCIs in national currency ended the month with a total net worth of $17,750 million, marking an increase of 5% with respect to October (3.8% if corrected by the effect of portfolio reclassification), generalized homogeneously for all its segments (see graph 7.5). Indeed, the fixed income segment increased 5.5%, to close the month at $6,440 million, with a new historical maximum for the fifth consecutive month in both net worth and participation. For its part, the equity segment was able to reverse the decline suffered during the first 8 months of the year (-20.5%) and increased 18.6% to finish November with a net worth of $1,670 million. It should be noted that net of the reclassification effect mentioned, the increase would be 6%. In this way it managed to increase its participation by 1.1%. Despite having reached its historical maximum value in pesos mid-month (see graph 7.6), the money market segment closed the month with
6,000 growth of only 1.9% (net of the reclassification effect would be 1.4%), totaling a patrimony of $8,260 million and the lowest participation in the last 2 years (from 47.9% in October to 46.5% in November). Finally, the mixed income segment grew again for the sixth consecutive month (6.2% in the month), ending with a patrimony of $1,375 million, more than triple the patrimony measured at the beginning of the year. Except for equity funds, which owe their movement exclusively to the change in their prices, the remaining funds attest to their respective increases both from price growth and from the quantity of fund shares registered.

Regarding FCI patrimony in foreign currency, although a monthly decline of 11.7% was recorded, concluding the month with a total patrimony of u$s 444 million ($1,775 million), this decline was explained almost exclusively by the reclassification of funds mentioned. If the figures are corrected, FCIs in foreign currency would register a decline of 1.8% in the month. Equity funds fell 34.3%, although corrected by the reclassification only 5.2%. The fixed income and money market segments also decreased although more slightly with 1.5% and 0.6% respectively. In contrast, the mixed income segment was the only fund that left a positive balance with an increase of 1.1%.

## Financial Trusts5

Through 19 operations, FF issuances totaled $2,445 million in November (see Chart 7.7), the largest amount after the record reached in July

5 Only trusts with public offering are considered.

Monetary Report | November 2010 | BCRA | 16 ($7,390 million). As in that occasion, this month several public sector issuances were recorded, which aimed to finance infrastructure works and represented 59% of the total issued in the month. Specifically, the last series of Sisvial6 was placed and the second series of the Hydraulic Infrastructure FF.

Regarding underlying assets, more than half corresponded to future fund flows7, thanks to public sector placements. For their part, loans linked to consumption (personal loans and credit card coupons), which would represent 84% of underlying assets (if the aforementioned placements were excluded), registered an increase of 11% compared to the previous month. Likewise, this month mortgage credits were found among the underlying assets (which had not been surveyed since July), upon placing a new series of Argentine Mortgage Bonds. In this way, they represented 12% of the total (if infrastructure FF are excluded). The remainder corresponded to commercial credits in dollars.

The principal settlor of the month was the National State, being responsible for the issuances intended to finance infrastructure works ($1,450 million). As for the rest of the settlors, in all cases a greater amount securitized was observed with respect to October and one of the highest amounts securitized in the year was reached in November (see Graph 7.8). In this sense, retail businesses and financial entities showed an active participation, as in the previous month, with a similar amount of securitized assets, around $380 million and $350 million in one and the other case, respectively, which implied an increase with respect to the previous month of 12% and 36%, respectively. For their part, mutuals, cooperatives, non-banking credit card issuers and other financial service providers practically doubled the amount of securitized assets in the past month. Among the settlors were also found SMEs linked to agricultural activity that securitized around $40 million.

The interest rates of the senior titles in pesos remained relatively stable. In effect, the amount-weighted average of the cutting rate of the variable-rate titles of shorter duration was located in November at 13.6%, registering a slight decline (0.2 p.p.). Additionally, three variable-rate operations were recorded in the highest duration tranche corresponding to the two infrastructure FFs and Argentine Mortgage Bonds, which yielded a cutting rate - amount-weighted average - of 15.9%. For their part, the cutting rate of fixed-rate titles reached 13.2%, 0.3 p.p. above that recorded in October (see Graph 7.9). For their part, given the placements of the infrastructure trusts and mortgage bonds, which are longer-term, the duration (amount-weighted average) of the senior titles increased considerably, from around 6 months in October to 46 months in November.
