# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information
 Communiqué No. 37699

## Monetary Situation (month of May)

During May, deposits increased, on average, $700 million (0.9%), evidencing growth much higher than that observed during previous months. Fixed-term deposits in dollars explained practically all of the growth.

Loans decreased 0.5% ($400 million), with most of the decline corresponding to those granted to the private sector, which decreased 0.5% ($330 million). Within these, the operation that contracted the most was that related to commercial activity, while mortgage loans showed an increase. For its part, loans granted to the public sector decreased 0.6% ($70 million) after several months of sustained growth.

Interest rates experienced increases in all operations. This behavior was associated with the increase in international interest rates and country risk.

## Private Banks (data as of March 2000)

During March 2000, total assets of private banks registered a slight decline of 0.6%, mainly due to the decrease in available funds (7.0%).

Total loans rose $200 million (0.4%), observing a significant increase in loans to the financial sector (10.0%). Loans to the local non-financial private sector registered a slight decline of almost $100 million, explained in part by the decrease in loans with documents.

The main sources of funding showed no significant variations, except for loan lines with the exterior which decreased $400 million (7.3%).

In March, private banks obtained profits of 7.9% (annualized) of net equity. Gains were observed especially in the increase in results from interest and miscellaneous items, and the decline in charges for loan losses. Similarly, high administration expenses and the significant increase in accrued income tax contributed to reducing the March result compared to February. Private banks finished the first quarter of 2000 with a profit of 8.1% (annualized) of net equity, obtaining the best quarterly result of the period January 1998 - March 2000.

The quality of the credit portfolio of private banks improved significantly during March. Thus, the irregular portfolio in terms of financing fell 0.3 percentage points, decreasing to 7.0%, while the irregular portfolio net of provisions in terms of financing went from 2.1% to 2.0%. For its part, credit risk, measured as the irregular portfolio net of provisions in terms of net equity, fell from 11.8% to 11.3%.

Regarding compliance with the integration of minimum capital, private banks registered no significant changes in either the requirement or total capital integration. Likewise, capital integration in terms of risk-weighted assets according to Basel verified a slight increase (0.2 percentage points) and continued to be maintained at a level (18.5%) much higher than that required by local regulation and internationally recommended.
