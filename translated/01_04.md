# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information
Communication No. 40.128

## Monetary Situation (March 2001)

In March there was a decline in deposits, considering monthly average figures, of around $1700
million (2%), which occurred mainly in deposits of the private sector. Although time deposits
were those that experienced the largest nominal declines ($1100 million), in percentage terms the decline
was 2%, while savings accounts, with a smaller nominal decline ($400 million), were the most affected
in percentage terms (3%). The decline in savings account deposits was associated with the behavior
of mutual investment funds, whose massive withdrawal of shares (especially those that maintained
investments in pesos) determined the need to utilize their demand deposits in financial entities. If the variations between end-of-month balances are considered, the decline in deposits was greater,
reaching almost $3800 million in the case of private sector deposits.

The surplus position of minimum liquidity requirements in February allowed the system as a whole
to meet the decline in deposits with almost no need to incur deficiencies in the March position.

As a consequence of the decline in the integration of liquidity requirements and, to a lesser extent, of
monetary circulation, the average stock of international reserves of the financial system experienced a decrease of
around US$1700 million compared to the February average. The comparison between end-of-month balances
shows a decline of around US$3700 million.

Finally, the increase in country risk, the difficulties in accessing external financing, and the decline in
deposits determined an increase in domestic interest rates. The average rate of interbank loans
(call) in dollars registered a maximum of 23% on the last day of the month. Furthermore, and given that the largest
decline in deposits occurred in those denominated in local currency, there was a growing need to
cover positions in pesos to avoid currency mismatch, leading to a sharp increase in the
interest rate in pesos, which reached 83% and ended the month at a level of 57%.

## Private Banks (data as of January 2001)

During January 2001, the total assets of the group of private banks registered an increase of 1.1% due
mainly to the increase of 4.3% in the item "Other credits from financial intermediation", which in turn
increased due to the effect of the increase in spot purchase and sale operations to be settled. The increase in total
assets was partially offset by the decline in loans, especially those granted to
the non-financial private sector (1.8%). As for alternative sources of funding, negotiable
obligations registered a decline of 5.1%, while loan lines from abroad decreased 14.5%,
essentially due to the actions of an important private bank.

In the first month of 2001, private banks registered profits equivalent to 8.9% of net equity in
annualized terms, thus continuing the upward trend observed since November 2000. The
positive variation in profitability compared to the previous month reflected the effect of the increase in results from
holding assets and the decline in administrative expenses, the latter due to seasonal factors. On the other hand, the
increase in loan loss provisions and accrued income tax partially offset the
positive effects mentioned above.

Due to modifications in the Monthly Reporting Regime, portfolio quality information is not
available at this time.
The total capital requirement of private banks registered a slight increase of 0.2% in January 2001, explained fundamentally by the increase in capital requirement for market risk (25.0%). On the other hand, the total capital integration increased 0.9% due to the increase in supplementary net equity. The variations in total requirement and total capital integration caused an increase in integration excess, which in terms of total capital requirement went from 47.2% to 48.3%. Finally, the total capital integration in terms of risk-weighted assets according to Basel rose 0.4 percentage points, placing itself at a level (20.1%) much higher than what is established by local regulation and by the recommended international minimum requirements.
