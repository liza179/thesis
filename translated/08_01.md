JANUARY 2008

CONTENTS 1. Summary 1
1. Summary 1 • In January, the monetary aggregate M2 averaged $154,550 million. Private
2. Monetary Aggregates 2 means of payment were below the evolution recorded in the same month of 2007, verifying a decrease in its year-on-year growth rate of 1 p.p. compared to December. Cash in circulation continued to decelerate its year-on-year growth rate, which has already accumulated 5 p.p. of decline compared to July. Sight deposits of the private sector also reduced their growth rate and, in January its annual rate of change was 1 p.p. lower than in December.

3. Banking Liquidity 3 • Mid-month, volatility in international financial markets increased, verifying significant declines in the quotations of the main financial assets at the global level. However, international financial turbulence has not had an impact on domestic variables. The prudential and countercyclical policies of the Central Bank, both in the monetary and financial sphere, have made it possible to cushion these effects, which was reflected in the stability in the exchange market and in local interest rates during that period.

4. Loans 4 • As a result of open market operations carried out by this institution, the local context showed ample liquidity that led to a widespread decline in interest rates. In the interbank loan market it decreased 1 p.p., reaching an average of 8%. Moreover, faced with the increase in volatility in international markets, said rate maintained its slightly downward trend and as of January 18 accumulated 0.4 p.p. of decline. Among passive rates, the evolution of the BADLAR rate of private banks stood out, which decreased 2.8 p.p. to reach an average of 10.7%.

5. Interest Rates 5 • Thus, in January, as a result of the actions implemented by the Central Bank since the crisis broke out at the end of July, the local monetary market presented a dynamic of normality. This demonstrates that the risk management approach based on prudent and consistent monetary policy that guarantees equilibrium between supply and demand in the money market, a managed floating regime and countercyclical financial policies has been appropriate to face any impact of financial turbulence on local economic performance.

BCRA Issued Securities 5 • In January, an increase was observed in the banking liquidity ratio in pesos—defined as cash in banks, bank current accounts at the BCRA and passive repos for the BCRA as a percentage of total deposits in pesos—which reached 20% of deposits. As in 2007, financial entities accumulate a surplus of integration in the quarterly position of minimum cash, on the order of 0.7%.

Interfinancial Markets 5 • The comfortable liquidity situation in banks meant that a decrease of $224 million in the average monthly balance of active repos was observed, and an increase of $5,212 million in the stock of passive repos. On the other hand, the BCRA stopped conducting repurchase auctions, and continued operating in the secondary market of LEBAC and NOBAC, although in smaller amounts. As a consequence of net placements in the primary market, the total stock of securities issued by the BCRA increased 4% compared to the previous month and was positioned at the end of January at a VN of $53,469 million.

 2. Monetary Aggregates1

 In January, the monetary aggregate M2 was located at $154,550 million. Among its components, expected behavior was observed and in particular, the M2 of the private sector evolved according to its seasonal pattern although its growth was below that registered in the same month of 2007. Thus, private means of payment registered a decrease in its year-on-year growth rate of 1 p.p. with respect to the previous month, explained by the joint deceleration of currency in circulation held by the public and demand deposits in pesos of the private sector.

This demonstrates that the risk management approach based on a prudent and consistent monetary policy that guarantees the balance between supply and demand in the money market, a managed floating regime and counter-cyclical financial policies has been appropriate for facing any impact of financial turbulences on local economic performance.

 In the case of currency in circulation held by the public, which since August has been showing a sustained process of deceleration in its growth rate (5 p.p. decline in the year-on-year variation rate), it ended January with growth for the last 12 months similar to that of early 2007. For its part, demand deposits of the private sector also reduced their growth rate and, in January their year-on-year variation rate was 1 p.p. lower than that of December.

Furthermore, it should be noted that throughout January of this year the growth of time deposits was distributed in similar proportions between placements of less than $1 million, which recovered their balances following the decline that had been observed during the months of greatest turbulence; and deposits of more than $1 million, driven by the growth in balances of financial services provider companies.

Given the liquidity existing in the market, the BCRA ceased to conduct repurchase auctions, and continued operating in the secondary market of LEBAC and NOBAC, although with a lower repurchase amount. On the other hand, as a consequence of net placements in the primary market, the total stock of titles issued by the BCRA increased in January 4% compared to the previous month (first increase since July 2007) and was located at the end of this month at a nominal value of $53,469 million.

27 12 Market (MULC) which totaled u$s1,700 million. Furthermore international
26 11 reserves increased due to their positive return

 In the foreign exchange market, the wholesale quotation of the peso
 against the dollar (Reference) average in the month had a slight
 depreciation of 0.2% compared to the previous month, quoting at 3.1444
 $/u$s (See Graph 6.2). Meanwhile, with respect to the Euro the peso also

 significant increase in volatility was observed (Graph 7.1), with
 Jul-03 Jan-04 Jul-04 Jan-05 Jul-05 Jan-06 Jul-06 Jan-07 Jul-07 Jan-08 lower liquidity and strong risk aversion. The S&P 500 showed
 Source: BCRA a loss of 6.1%; the MEXBOL (Mexico) of 2.5% and the BOVESPA
 (Brazil) of 6.9%; all measured in original currency. On the other
 hand, the VIX –index that measures the volatility of the S&P- was located on
 average in January at 25.8% (4.1 p.p. more compared to the average
 recorded the previous month).

 For its part, throughout January there were strong
 fluctuations in the stock market indices. The futures of the main
Graph 6.2 North American stock indices fell 10% before the

$/US$ Nominal Reference Exchange Rate (Wholesale) opening of the markets on January 22 and after the Monday
 3.20 holiday on 21. This fall did not fully translate to the spot indices
 when the FED announced that day that it had decided to make the largest cut
 3.15 in fed funds (75 b.p.) at an out-of-schedule meeting. The
 markets were discounting a decrease of these characteristics for the
 3.10 January 30/31 meeting but the FED moved forward, due to the
 growing risk of recession in the U.S. Despite the out-of-
 3.05 schedule decrease and because financial markets were still
 facing a situation of stress and adjustment in the credit market,
 3.00 the FED decided on January 31 another decrease of 50 b.p.

 In Argentina, during January the MERVAL index -measured in

During January there was greater risk aversion among investors to invest in fixed income securities of emerging countries, with the counterpart of this phenomenon being greater demand for 10-year US Treasury bonds, which increased in price. In this sense, the Credit Default Swaps (CDS) of Argentina at 5 years increased 36 b.p., the CDS of Brazil at 5 years did so by 95 b.p., although the price of these is lower than that of Argentina's CDS. Another measure of emerging country spreads, the EMBI+ increased 33 b.p. For its part, the spread of Latin America's external debt measured by the EMBI increased 34 b.p. during January.

The equity of mutual funds denominated in pesos reached $16,543 million (see Chart 7.6 – left quadrant), which represents a decrease of only $178 million compared to the previous month (1.1%). Variable income funds were those that marked the negative sign in the equity evolution of mutual funds, since mixed income, fixed income and money market funds showed growth in their equity, although they failed to compensate for the decline in variable income funds.

Meanwhile, mutual funds denominated in foreign currency (dollars and euros) totaled $5,085 million, $549 million above what was recorded in December (12.1%).

As mentioned, variable income mutual funds experienced a setback in their equity of $1,688 million (21.6%), placing themselves at $6,139 million due to both withdrawals of fund shares and the decline in returns (given the situation in the international financial market and its effect on stock exchanges, which also encouraged transfers to more conservative investments). This meant that after many months they are positioned in second place in terms of their participation in the total (37%). In contrast, money market funds grew 10.5% both due to improvements in returns and increases in the quantities of fund shares, which made it possible to reach an equity of $7,228 million and represent 44% of the total funds. Finally, the equity of fixed income funds showed a positive variation of 39% ($813), as did mixed income funds which evidenced a patrimonial expansion of $8 million (2.9%).

## Financial Trusts

In January, financing through financial trusts totaled $781 million through 28 issues (see Chart 7.7). This represented an 8% decline in amounts compared to the same month of the previous year, although almost double the number of securitizations were recorded in terms of quantity. It should be noted that when comparing to the previous month, there was a decrease in the total securitized (-38%), which respected the behavior observed in January 2007. The issues reached an average amount per placement of $28 million, falling below the figure of the previous month ($31 million) and that of the 2007 average which was $35 million.

The underlying assets of the financial trusts issued that stood out most were, in January, credit card vouchers and commercial credits which quadrupled the value reached in the same month of the previous year. Additionally, consumption-linked assets continued to lead the total (personal loans and credit card vouchers, with 53% and 31% respectively, see Chart 7.7).

In the first month of the year, the main settlors were retail merchants, which concentrated 35.7%, followed by financial institutions not regulated by the BCRA and entities...

 in interest rates in the money market. In fact, the
 interest rates of the senior securities were located at 13.1%, for fixed-rate
 securities and 14.6% for those placed at variable rates (weighted average
 by amount issued), which implies a reduction of more than 4 p.p. in both
 cases. When comparing such rates with the BADLAR Private Banks rate
 (as a reference indicator of another potential investment) a spread
 of 2.5 p.p. emerges for the first case and 3.9 p.p. for the second, which
 means a significant decline in such gap according to records from
 previous months. However,
