Private Banks (September 1999)

Between August and September 1999, the assets of private banks grew almost 2%. Overall, the liquidity of the entities (cash and equivalents, public securities and liquidity requirements) increased $2,000 million. This increase breaks down into $450 million in cash and other available funds, $600 million in holdings of public securities and $950 million in integration of liquidity requirements. This last figure includes a decline of $200 million in active repurchase agreements with deposit certificates, which form part of the integration of liquidity requirements and are recorded in "Other credits from financial intermediation."

During September, loans to the public sector grew $250 million, while those granted to the non-financial private sector decreased by just over $300 million (basically, the balances of advances, documents and other loans fell).

On the funding sources side, an important increase in deposits was observed: almost $900 million, that is, 1.6%. Strong increases were also recorded in the balances of external credit lines ($350 million) and negotiable obligations (just under $200 million).

The profitability of private banks registered a high value again in September: 8.0% of net worth, on an annualized basis. The greater profits are explained by a significant increase in results from asset holdings and a sharp decrease in charges for uncollectibility.

The delinquency indicators of the credit portfolio of private banks showed no changes with respect to August. Only a slight decrease in the irregularity of the commercial portfolio was recorded (from 5.0% to 4.9%) and a slight increase in the irregularity of the portfolio for consumption or housing (from 12.3% to 12.4%).

As of August, figures corresponding to the capital requirement for interest rate risk began to be received. This requirement reached in September a value of $87 million for private banks, which represents only 1% of the capital requirement for credit risk. For its part, the integration of capital in terms of risk assets calculated according to the Basel criterion remained at 17.5%, well above the internationally recommended minimum (8%).
