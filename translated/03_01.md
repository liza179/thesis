**Monthly Monetary Report**
**January 2003**

**Summary**

ü The agreement with the IMF, which will allow facing the obligations contracted with international financial organizations until the month of August, includes —among others— monetary targets. Two of them, associated with a minimum of net international reserves and a maximum of net internal assets, are of mandatory character, while the target associated with a maximum limit of broad monetary base (including quasi-money) is of indicative character. The targets for the month of January were exceeded.

ü The broad monetary base increased by $340 million between end points (0.9%, which compares to an average growth of 6.8% monthly in the period September-December 2002). The external sector was again the main expansion factor, although in smaller quantity than in previous months, as a result of the flexibilization of regulations associated with the foreign exchange market. The government and the financial sector, for their part, registered a net contractionary effect.

ü The evolution of means of payment was approximately in line with the seasonal pattern typical of the month. Indeed, the private M2 aggregate grew from early December until the first fortnight of January, and then began an incipient decline. Between end points, private M2 decreased by $460 million during January; such decrease was due to the change in monetary circulation, since private deposits resumed growth.

ü Fixed-term deposits resumed a growth rhythm similar to that observed during the second half of last year —with increases on the order of $2,000 million monthly. The increase in these placements was driven by the segment ranging from 30 to 59 days. The level reached by private fixed-term deposits exceeds by 14% that recorded at the end of last December.

ü Interest rates for time deposits showed declines that brought them —on average— to levels between 4 and 6 percentage points lower than those of the previous month, for placement brackets up to 90 days. Meanwhile, in the foreign exchange market the appreciation of the peso continued with respect to the dollar (4% in the month) and the euro (3%). Although it showed changes within the month, the relationship between the peso and the real did not register variations between end points with respect to December, extending the relative stability of recent months.

ü Loans to the private sector continue showing a downward trend, registering net cancellations for a total amount of $750 million.

ü In this month the second largest monthly net placement of LEBACs in the primary market was carried out since the appearance of these instruments, for a total amount of $766 million. The average maturity continues increasing —at the end of January it reached 139 days. Improvements in placement conditions were achieved without increasing the average nominal cost of the portfolio.

ü The greater regularity in the development of monetary variables appears particularly significant given the partial lifting of financial restrictions known as "corralón" (currently, such restrictions reach only 25% of deposits, compared to almost 100% a year ago). The available information indicates that the degree of acceptance by savers regarding the offer of early repayment of CEDRO by some financial institutions is relatively low.

ü After three months with increases not exceeding half a percentage point, January inflation rose to 1.3%. The price variation, lower than expected, was mainly due to seasonal factors (mainly tourism).

**January 2003**

**The agreement with the IMF and monetary targets**
The conclusion of negotiations with the IMF was one of the most relevant events that occurred in the month of January. The agreement establishes the granting of a stand by credit to cover obligations with the organization (including interest) until August 2003 and to refinance those whose payments were scheduled but did not have binding character. This agreement was essential not only to avoid default of the debt maintained with international organizations but also to unblock World Bank loans conditioned on the fulfillment of these obligations.

The agreement implies the commitment on the part of the government to meet certain goals, both fiscal and monetary. Specifically, the BCRA commits to reaching a set of bimonthly monetary targets set by mutual agreement as of January 7, 2003. The targets are three, two of binding character and one indicative. The first establish a minimum level of net international reserves (RIN) and a maximum level of net domestic assets (AIN), while the latter refers to a maximum level for broad monetary base - defined as monetary circulation, the current account of financial entities at the BCRA and the stock of quasi-monies. The level of variables subject to compliance with these targets is measured taking into account the simple average of the 10 business days before and after the date under consideration.

RIN are defined as the BCRA's gross international reserves minus the liabilities it maintains with the IMF and their measurement is carried out in dollars to avoid distortions from exchange rate fluctuations. Likewise, it was established that the target should be adjusted by the equivalent of the net flow of foreign exchange with international organizations, since this does not affect the BCRA's liabilities.

AIN are defined as the broad monetary base minus RIN valued at an exchange rate of 3.85$/USD. In this case, the target consists of keeping the level of AIN below a determined ceiling (note that, since RIN are negative at this moment, AIN result higher than the broad monetary base). Finally, an indicative (maximum) target was established for the broad monetary base.

As of January 31, the first measurement period, all targets were being widely exceeded. It should be noted that the relevant figure for compliance with the targets is the average of business days between January 17 and February 14. Therefore, the table summarizes the degree of compliance considering the days elapsed in January and the first 14 days of February (although the rest of this report uses all information through January 31).

**Table 1**

| | Observed | Target | Deviation* |
|---|---|---|---|
| Net domestic assets (AIN) | 53.375 | 57.604 | -4.229 |
| Net international reserves (RIN) | -4.302 | -5.287 | 985 |
| Broad monetary base (indicative) | 36.813 | 37.250 | -437 |

*Deviation: In AIN and Monetary Base the negative sign (-) indicates over-compliance. In RIN the positive sign (+) indicates over-compliance.

## Evolution of the monetary base

During January, the broad monetary base increased by $340 million (0.9%) although in real terms its variation was negative (-0.4%). As in previous months, the main, and on this occasion the only, expansion factor of the monetary base was the monetization derived from the purchase of foreign currency by the BCRA. It should be noted, however, that this effect was much smaller in January than in previous months. This was fundamentally due to a series of measures enacted by the BCRA aimed at normalizing the foreign exchange market, which are detailed below. Collectively, they led to lower base expansion on the part of the BCRA.

The BCRA sterilized through market operations around one quarter of purchases from the liquidation of exports. Therefore, the balance of the net purchase of foreign currency was expansive by $1,680 million (USD 500 million).

 Operations with the National Government resulted in contractions of $540 million. It should be noted
that during January advances to the National Treasury of $3,670 million were made, in addition to
transfers of utilities pending from 2002 of $477 million¹. However, these funds did not affect the
monetary base because they were allocated to payment of obligations contracted with international
organizations (payments that amounted to approximately $4,600 million, equivalent to USD 1,500
million, within the framework of the IMF agreement, which provides for future disbursements in
amounts equivalent to the payments made). Additionally, the Government financed itself with its
deposits in the financial system, which generated the monetary contraction mentioned.

1 The difference with the figure published in the Monthly Monetary Summary is due to the utility advance to finance
an external payment of $56 million, accounted for in January but corresponding to the month of December.

 Monthly Monetary Report
 January 2003

 Operations between the Central Bank and financial entities, for their part, resulted in contractions
of approximately $80 million. This contraction was due to payment by the entities of premiums and
interest on assistance received. The latter was partially offset by the crediting of remuneration of
their current accounts at the BCRA.

 The BCRA's gross international reserves fell USD 1,150 million, as a result of payments to
international organizations that were partially offset by net purchases of foreign currency in the
market by the BCRA. In this way, reserves ended the month at USD 9,326 million.

Monetary Aggregates

 The evolution of the means of payment during January, as had occurred in December, was
approximately in line with the seasonal pattern typical of the month. In effect, the private M2
aggregate² grew from the beginning of December until the first half of January, and then began an
incipient decline. The decline is also reflected in real terms: as observed in the chart, following a
rebound in real M2 in December, there follows a decrease in this variable (to levels still slightly
lower than those recorded in November).

 To compute the real M2, the monthly averages of this aggregate are deflated by the Consumer
Price Index (CPI-GBA); in January, this index registered an increase of 1.3% with respect to December,
lower than expected although well above the variations recorded in previous months (which did not
exceed half a percentage point). The change in the price level is attributable, however, to mostly
seasonal factors: the items with the greatest impact on the index were food and beverages and
entertainment. The latter was associated with early-year tourist activity –note that the item with the
highest individual increase was hotels on the Atlantic coast).

The behavior of nominal M2 was not as associated in January with greater demand for currency in circulation as it was in December. Bills and coins held by the public increased

 Monthly Monetary Report

during the first half of January by $269 million3 –thus continuing the growth verified in December–, while in the second half they decreased by $348 million. Thus, during the month the variation of this item was of little significance, decreasing by almost $80 million. Considering average figures, currency in circulation held by the public increased in the first month of the year by 6.6% compared to the previous month.

 Private demand deposits exhibited a relatively moderate variation: during the month they decreased by approximately $380 million. Their composition did not remain unchanged: partially reversing what was observed in December, placements in current account decreased by $550 million (–4.7%), while those in savings accounts increased by about $170 million (2%). Thus, private M2 decreased by $460 million between the end of December and the end of January, corroborating (at least partially) the seasonal pattern mentioned.

 The evolution presented by the means of payment appears to mark a proportion with respect to bills and coins more compatible with "normal" monetary conditions than that observed the previous year, when restrictions on deposit withdrawals resulted in a singular increase in the stock of bills and coins during January (which was later prolonged by an unusual increase from early February onwards). Although –as can be seen in the chart– a pattern is not now returning completely similar to that of previous years, it is important to highlight that monetary circulation grew until mid-January and then exhibited an incipient contraction. This fact becomes particularly relevant in the context of the opening of the so-called "corralón": just as occurred following the opening of the financial "corralito", the system reacts without showing significant impacts. The evolution of currency in circulation tends incipient to align with the seasonal pattern characteristic of the month. Thus, one might expect a slight uptick in demand for bills and coins at the beginning of February, which should decline in the second half of that month.

 If broader aggregates are observed –those that include, in addition to transactional items, time deposits– the scenario of tranquility on the monetary front is corroborated. Fixed-term deposits increased by more than $2,500 million pesos between December 31 and January 31. In this way, a growth rate in fixed-term deposits more similar to that observed during the

second half of last year –increases on the order of $2,000 million monthly– was resumed, in contrast with the "preference for liquidity" evidenced in December –when the increase had been $500 million–; as we noted in our previous report, the marked deceleration of these deposits in December was related to the habitual inclination to maintain more liquid positions at year-end.
The increase in private time deposits was driven by the segment ranging from 30 to 59 days—as has been occurring since these deposits began to recover in the middle of last year. The segment ranging from 60 to 89 days was the next most important, while the shorter-term segments—7 to 13 and 14 to 29 days—registered smaller absolute variations or even negative ones. It is important to note that the level reached by fixed-term deposits (which, as they are not directly linked to transactional needs, more accurately reflect the investment decisions of economic agents) exceeds by more than 14% that recorded at the end of last December. Likewise, a slight increase in the average term of these placements is observed between December and January.

Banks had to face liquidity needs associated with CEDRO de-allocations for a total of approximately $1,000 million. Within these de-allocations, it is worth mentioning that payments for amparo resources were substantially reduced mainly due to the judicial recess. With data as of January 31, such payments amounted to $155 million and, including the exchange rate adjustment, the amount rises to $255 million. In contrast, this figure exceeded $1,000 million in previous months. Considering the total de-allocations and the evolution of placements mentioned above, the entities increased their private deposits by $1,400 million. Taking into account the evolution of currency in circulation mentioned earlier, the private M3 aggregate increased by $1,360 million.

The aforementioned increase in private sector deposits was led by six entities that increased their deposits by more than $100 million each during the month of January, which are among the largest in the system (within the group that captured the most there are also two public banks). The banks that followed them are a dozen medium-sized entities, private, provincial and cooperative ones. The rest of the system observed mostly null variations, while a group of 10 entities exhibited significant decreases. When grouping the different banks according to their character (public, private, cooperative) and origin, we find that public banks were those that received the largest increase in deposits ($600 million), followed by banks with predominantly foreign capital ($390 million) and national private banks ($173 million). In all cases, it is fixed-term deposits that explain the increase, as can be seen in the graph.

The greater regularity in the development of monetary variables appears particularly significant in the context of the partial lifting of financial restrictions known as the "corralón". Thus, at the end of January some entities decided to offer the early return of rescheduled deposits, since even those that have received assistance from the monetary authority can advance their payment (under the condition that for each peso returned early, one peso of the rediscounts granted by the BCRA is cancelled). As of January 31, two banks were carrying out early returns, while other entities were beginning to announce their intention to do the same. The available information indicates that the degree of acceptance by savers is relatively low.

**Liquidity and Passive Interest Rates: Evolution by Bank Groups**

It is relevant to verify the behavior of liquidity and passive interest rates of the groups of banks that captured relatively more deposits. Defining liquidity as the sum of the banks' current account at the BCRA plus their cash holdings, an increase in deposit capture is verified - linked with the intention to rebuild liquidity to mainly cover early CEDRO payment, amparo resources, etc. The expected behavior tends to be observed here: the entities that captured more deposits were those that increased their liquidity position to a greater extent, while those that lost them reduced such position. When deposit behavior is compared with that of interest rates, the relationship is not

particularly strong: although the downward behavior of interest rates appears associated with increases in deposits, there is an appreciable number of entities for which this is not confirmed.

Variation in Liquidity (Liquidity = Current Account at BCRA + Cash in Banks, mill $) | Variation in deposits
# EVOLUTION OF LOANS

If we focus on the private banks that exhibited the largest variations in deposits, in all of them a clear decrease in rates is observed. In general, decreases in the liquidity position are also found along with drops in deposits; however, a clear decline (or increase) in rates associated with greater (or lesser) available liquidity continues to not be recorded. This leads us to seek some other type of grouping that can better explain the behavior of these variables.

Thus, it is possible to classify banks among those that have received (and currently maintain in their liabilities) rediscounts from the BCRA and those that have not (among these latter, a distinction can be made between those that hold LEBAC holdings and those that do not). The logic behind this classification is as follows: banks that receive assistance for illiquidity should be orienting themselves more specifically toward the capture of deposits (with the objective of recomposing their liquidity), the reverse of those that have not requested such assistance. The former should increase their liquidity position, and present rates higher than the latter (within the group of these latter, those that participate in LEBAC auctions should tend to align their rates with those of these instruments). For the months of December and January, the data are consistent in principle with such relationships: the group of banks with rediscounts includes those that have seen the largest increase in their private deposits between both months, and pay relatively higher rates, on average, for 30-day deposits; on the contrary, the set of banks without rediscounts records a decrease in their deposits, and their rates offered for fixed-term placements are lower. In January, banks with rediscounts paid on average rates of 19% for their 30-day deposits, while those that did not receive assistance paid rates of 14% for such placements. Also, and as can be observed in the graph, although all types of banks decreased their rates between December and January, banks that do not have rediscounts are those that verify the largest decline.

Throughout the month of January, interest rates on fixed-term deposits showed declines that brought them—on average—to levels between 4 and 6 percentage points lower than those of the previous month, for the tranches of placements up to 90 days. Thus, interest rates for deposits of between 14 and 30 days of maturity reached an average level of 16%. For deposits with maturity greater than three months, the decrease was even greater, and reached between 7 and 9 percentage points. These interest rates continue to be high in real terms, given the observed inflation and that no significant increases in prices are expected.

In the call market, the average amount traded up to 15 days of maturity increased by 7%, although in historical terms the market continues to be very illiquid. Also, as in the rest of the markets, the interest rate showed a slight decline, averaging in the month a level of 5.6%.

**Evolution of Loans**
During the month of January, loans to the private sector continued to show a declining trend, registering net cancellations totaling $750 million. The majority of cancellations were concentrated in public banks, branches of foreign banks, and banks with predominantly foreign capital, while domestic private banks registered a slight increase in their stock of loans, both commercial and consumer loans.

Given that the credit market is depressed, the levels of net cancellations currently observed can be associated with the absence of new loans, particularly in the consumer area. The depression of the credit market is explained by the scarce demand for credit, linked to the low level of activity, and by the lack of loan supply, associated with the risk asset positioning policies maintained by banking entities.

The stock of consumer loans decreased in January by $370 million, of which 60% corresponds to the mortgage portfolio, 22% to the collateral loan portfolio, 13% to the personal credit portfolio, and the remainder to credit cards. Faced with the lack of granting new loans, what appears to have been observed since early last year is a decline in capital stock due to maturation – this factor, rather than cancellation against unallocated deposits, would be the one that would explain to a greater extent the evolution of credits. Although strong total mortgage cancellations were registered during last year in absolute terms, the pace of cancellations was stabilizing toward year-end and it is observed that the rate of variation of these is much greater in personal loans and collateral loans, due to their shorter terms, than in mortgage loans, as these are credits with longer maturity periods. Credit card financing, for its part, continues to show a declining trend associated with the low level of consumption.

In the case of commercial loans, in January a net cancellation of $400 million was observed, of which 50% corresponds to documents, 44% to overdrafts in current accounts, and the remainder to other loans. Given that the commercial credit portfolio is related to industrial activity, the high level of net cancellations in January, in relation to that of previous months, can be associated with lower granting of new credit due to the summer recess.

Foreign Exchange Market: the strengthening of the peso continues
In the foreign exchange market, the peso continued to appreciate against the dollar, reaching 5% in the month (according to the reference exchange rate published by BCRA). This was due to the fact that the supply of dollars generated by foreign trade operations was not accompanied by an increase of equal magnitude in demand. The peso appreciation was partially attenuated by the effect associated with the foreign exchange flexibility measures mentioned in this same report. The still high real interest rates in pesos have also had some influence, making placements in domestic currency more attractive. The volatility of the peso⁴ stood at 34% annualized at the end of the month, above the average of 8% annualized recorded for the period between August and December 2002. Likewise, it is observed that from the second part of January onwards, the volatility of the spot exchange rate exceeded that of the forward exchange rate with maturity at the end of February, according to the quotation registered in the Rosario Forward Market.

It is relevant to highlight that the greater volatility observed is related to the lesser intervention of the Central Bank in the foreign exchange market: in fact, the lesser presence of BCRA tends toward a normalization of the market, and thus volatility reflects the increasingly free character of operations between private parties – we are therefore facing volatility of a "healthy" character. During January, the Central Bank took a series of measures aimed at eliminating the restrictions previously imposed on the foreign exchange market. The following comments address such measures.

• Increase in the maximum limit of the ratio between the general foreign exchange position of entities in relation to their Computable Equity Responsibility. This went from 5% (which had been in effect until the end of 2002) and was increased first to 6% and then to 8%. Financial entities took advantage of this flexibility, slightly increasing their position. It is estimated that said increase was USD 88 million for the entire system.

• Flexibility in the advance payment of imports of capital goods, spare parts, and components (comm. "A" 3846), a measure later extended to the rest of import payments (comm. "A" 3859). While in the first case the effects might still not be significant (at least until economic recovery deepens), in the second case the effects were already felt during the month of January, estimating a flow of USD 16 million, which could be maintained and even increased in the coming months.

• Liberalization of the payment of financial interest (comm. "A" 3843) and profits and dividends (comm. "A" 3859). This measure allowed economic agents to quickly regularize their commitments with the exterior. In the first case it is estimated that in January USD 90 million was transferred for interest and USD 69 million for profits and dividends.

• Flexibility in the payment of principal. While certain restrictions still remain, during the month several measures were taken that allowed: on one hand, the monthly cancellation of up to USD 150,000 per debtor; on the other hand, to pay 10% in cash of the financial debt when a refinancing of the rest of it is carried out for at least 5 years average life; and, finally, it was ordered to allow the purchase of foreign currency for the establishment of a fiduciary fund for the restructuring of financial debt. These last two measures will have a less immediate effect, because debtors will have to undertake a restructuring process with their creditors. However, already in the month of January some operations were completed for around USD 24 million.

• For all economic agents, the total amount of foreign currency purchases for portfolio investment and direct investment was increased from USD 100,000 to USD 150,000. This entailed a monthly increase of USD 40 million in the demand for foreign currency.

• The minimum amount of export operations, whose foreign currency banks must cede to the BCRA, was raised from USD 200,000 to USD 1,000,000 (comm. "A" 3619). Thus, the functioning of the foreign exchange market was practically normalized, since the vast majority of operations are now channeled through agents authorized to operate in foreign exchange, without intervention of the Central Bank. These agents have been permitted to still carry out intraday foreign exchange transactions, with the sole restriction that all operations must be carried out through the SIOPEL Electronic System. This has allowed rapid modernization of the sphere in which transactions are carried out. In the attached chart one can observe the sharp reduction in the purchase of foreign currency from exporters by this Central Bank, as a consequence of this measure, declining its average from USD 60 million per day to USD 10 million.

• In order to avoid the problems that the lack of credit lines currently granted by agents causes in the market, the BCRA has begun to act as a true intermediator
in transactions, at no cost to the parties. This procedure has contributed to unblocking
 the foreign exchange market, which is possible to verify by analyzing the strong increase that
 foreign exchange transactions had among agents. In fact, in the attached charts one can observe
 both the growth that transactions between third parties channeled through the Central Bank
 had, which currently reach an average of USD 20 million per day, as well as the

 strong increase that occurred in the volume traded daily through the Siopel-Forex system of the MAE, whose average grew, in less than a month, from USD 20 million per day to more than USD 100 million. It is important to note the growth in operations between entities that has occurred since the beginning of this year: there has been a sharp reduction in the direct intervention of the Central Bank in the foreign exchange market, and since then operations between agents themselves have become increasingly important.

 January 2003

 With respect to the relationship between the peso and the real, although a depreciation of the peso of 11% was observed in the first 10 days of January, the month ended at the same level as December. For its part, the peso appreciated 3% with respect to the euro.

Improvements in the placement conditions of LEBAC

 During the course of the month, the second largest monthly net placement of LEBAC in the primary market was carried out since the appearance of these instruments in March 2002. This fact, which implied a monetary contraction of $766 million, was carried out mainly through the award of LEBAC in pesos with 6 and 9 months maturity. This, added to the beginning of placements of this type of debt in pesos with maturity within 5 and 12 months allowed for continued increase in average maturity, which at the end of January reached 139 days –against 103 days at the end of December. As of January 31, the stock of LEBAC in pesos was $4,138 million while that in dollars was USD 182 million. These improvements were achieved without increasing the average nominal cost of the portfolio, which was 32.8% at the end of January (against 34.3% at the end of December). This was because the marginal cost of each of the auctions observed an appreciable decline -of 10 percentage points on average with respect to the last auction of December 2002. Despite this result, a reversal was verified in the declining trend of marginal cost in the latest auctions, basically due to the larger placement of LEBAC with longer average life.

 On the other hand, if the expectations of interest rates for LEBAC in pesos implicit in the interest rates paid in the auctions5 are considered, three characteristics stand out (only three of the nine auctions held in January are graphed taking into account that they are representative for the total of them). First, after a month, one could infer the anticipation of an increase in cost for placements regardless of their term –since the implicit forward rate curve
5 When speaking of implicit rates we are referring to the following: each auction determines rates of return for
different terms (corresponding to LEBACs with different maturities). Between, for example, the 30-day
maturity and the 60-day maturity, there is an implicit forward rate of one month. That is, the 60-day rate
expresses in part (implicitly) the expectation about what the one-month rate will be in 30 days.

is always found above the yield curve of the corresponding auction. In this regard, it should be noted that
the same had occurred in previous months, although subsequently said increase in interest rates was not
verified, which may be associated with a liquidity premium and not with an expectation of rate increases,
given that the secondary market for LEBACs is still relatively illiquid. Second, we find a smaller spread
between the interest rates paid and those expected after one month has elapsed, for instruments with an
average life greater than 5 months. This could be linked to the high relative returns that longer-term debt
currently provides. Finally, and in line with the evolution of the primary market, a gradual flattening of the
forward rate curve is observed during the month. Simultaneously, an increase in the slope of the yield curves
resulting from auctions for maturities after April 2003 is evident, evidencing the uncertainty associated
with the electoral process.

The Stock Market, Decoupled from International Evolution

The behavior of the domestic stock market, measured through the evolution of the MERVAL index,
showed a positive result of 4.7% during the month of January (when the effect of peso appreciation with
respect to the dollar is incorporated, the result rises to 10.7%). This was mainly a consequence of the
increase recorded in the first half of this period, which was linked to the completion of the agreement
signed with the I.M.F. and the relaxation of controls on the foreign exchange market. On the other hand,
the positive performance of this index was completely decoupled from the evolution of the stock markets
of developed countries and also from the performance of shares in Brazil.

The imminent armed confrontation between the United States and Iraq had a negative impact not only
on the behavior of US stock markets, but also depressed expectations regarding future demand for
European and Japanese products. This was accentuated by the decrease in credit ratings of some of the
largest Japanese banks and greater uncertainty regarding future quotations of English real estate market
prices. Likewise, the possibility of war breaking out prevents international investors from

taking aggressive positions on riskier assets, such as shares trading on the Brazilian stock exchange.
