# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information
Communication No. 35926

During October, deposits grew on average 0.1% (80 million pesos) and accumulated growth of 6.5% for the year. An important increase in dollar deposits was observed again, compensated only in part by a decline in peso placements. The dollarization of fixed-term deposits reached 76%. The international reserves of the financial system experienced an increase associated with greater integration of minimum liquidity requirements by financial entities. The ratio of liquidity requirements integration with respect to deposits reached 21%.

During October, loans showed an increase of 0.4% (300 million pesos) and accumulated growth of 4.5% for the year. For its part, interest rates presented average levels higher than those observed in September.

Private Banks (August 1999)

During August 1999, the assets of private banks decreased slightly (less than 2%). The contraction of banking activity originated in lower deposit capture (300 million pesos) and foreign loan lines (350 million pesos). This decline in the flow of funds determined mainly a decrease in the integration of liquidity requirements and the holding of public securities (900 million pesos) and a reduction in loans (150 million pesos, 100 million pesos of which correspond to placements abroad).

The profitability of private banks recovered in August, registering 5.4% (annualized) in terms of net equity. This level is higher than the average registered during the year. The increase in profitability was due to higher income from holding financial assets and lower charges for non-collectible accounts.

The main indicators of delinquency of private banks showed no changes between July and August. The only appreciable variation was recorded in the ratio of irregular portfolio net of provisions on net equity, which decreased by one percentage point, reaching 13.9%.

The excess capital integration of private banks registered a significant increase during August 1999: in terms of total requirements it went from 29% to 33%. This increase is due to the fact that the changes introduced in the table of risk indicators by interest rate starting in August determined a substantial decline in the requirement for credit risk (slightly more than 4%). On the other hand, integration in terms of risk assets (calculated according to the Basel criterion) fell slightly, standing at 17.3%.
