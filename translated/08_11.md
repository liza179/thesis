Monetary Report | November 2008 | BCRA | 2

## 1. Summary¹

• Faced with a scenario of persistent volatility in international markets, demand for local currency stabilized in November following the decline recorded in October. The monetary aggregate M2 registered a monthly average balance of $159,470 million, showing an annual growth of 14.1%.

• To understand the behavior of monetary aggregates in November, variations between end of month must be considered since their decline in October left an important negative statistical carryover. M2 grew 1.4% over the course of the month while M3 in pesos ended at a level of almost 1% above that at the end of October. Regarding the components of M3 from the private sector, both currency in circulation and private deposits registered increases of 1.1% and 1.3% respectively.

• The liquidity ratio of financial entities (the sum of cash in banks, checking accounts of banks at the BCRA and reverse repos with the BCRA) remained at historically elevated levels and averaged 20.3% of deposits in pesos. This measurement practically showed no variation with respect to the previous month. By adding the holdings of LEBAC and NOBAC of the entities, the liquidity ratio was positioned at 37.2%.

• To improve the management of banking liquidity during a period of elevated demand for transactional money such as December, it was provided that as of the 1st of that month, 100% of the cash maintained by entities would be computed for the integration of reserve requirements. Additionally, continuing with the policy of providing resources if necessary, in mid-November, the available limit for the granting of active repos at a fixed rate was increased, which went from $3,000 million to $10,000 million for the total of entities.

• The normalization of private deposits in pesos meant that from the second half of November a downward trajectory prevailed for short-term interest rates, producing declines in the most representative segments of the money market. In particular, the interbank loan interest rate (call) for 1 business day operations ended the month at 12.8%, 1.5 p.p. less than the last day of October. For its part, the BADLAR rate for private banks was positioned at the end of the month at 18.7%, with a decline of 4.3 p.p. with respect to the level recorded at the end of October.

• Loans in pesos to the private sector showed an increase of 0.5% ($570 million) over the course of November. In this way, they continued to soften their expansion rate, varying in annual terms by 26.4%. Growth in the month under review was driven by personal loans and credit card financing, which together increased 0.8%.

2. Monetary Aggregates

In a context of persistent volatility in international markets, demand for local currency stabilized in November following the decline recorded in October. The M2 monetary aggregate registered a monthly average balance of $159,470 million, showing year-over-year growth of 14.1%. In order to understand the evolution of monetary aggregates in the month under analysis and given the marked downward trajectory observed in these during the month of October, which left significant negative statistical carry-over, reference will be made to variations between end of month.

The M2 monetary aggregate grew 1.4% over the course of the month, with year-over-year variation of 14.1%, while the broader aggregate in pesos, M3, ended at levels almost 1% above those at the end of October. When considering aggregates of the private sector, the behaviors are similar, with growth of 1.6% and 1.2% in the case of M2 and M3, respectively.

Regarding the components of M3, currency in circulation exhibited an increase of 1.1%, while private deposits grew 1.2% (see Graph 2.1) and public sector deposits experienced a slight decline (0.2%).

In the on-demand deposit segment, both public sector deposits and private sector deposits showed an increase over the course of the month of 0.4% and 2.1% respectively. Meanwhile, the variation in time deposits resulted in a contraction of 0.5%, showing dissimilar behaviors by sectors. While private placements increased, those of the public sector declined. In particular, private time deposits increased 0.1% (see Graph 2.2), while those of the public sector decreased 1.5%. Similarly, private placements showed dissimilar behavior over the course of the month by segment. While in the retail segment (placements of up to $1 million) a decrease was observed, in the wholesale segment an increase was recorded.

In the foreign currency segment, total deposits increased over the course of November by 1.9%. This growth was explained by the increase in private sector placements, which totaled u$s280 million (3.5%) and was comprised of on-demand deposits.

When considering the broader aggregate, M3*, which includes currency in circulation and the total of deposits in pesos and foreign currency, growth of 1% in the month is observed and year-over-year growth of 16.6%.

Regarding prices, in November the Rest sub-index of the GBA CPI prepared by INDEC (which excludes the measurement of prices with seasonal behavior, subject to regulation or with high imported component) presented a monthly increase of 0.3%, which was lower than the rise in November 2007 (1.3%). In this way, the year-over-year (y.o.y.) growth rate of the Rest CPI was reduced to 9.7%, placing itself 1.0 percentage point (p.p.) below what was observed one year ago.

 3. Bank Liquidity1

 The average liquidity of financial entities continued to
 be at historically elevated levels and in November it was
 20.3%, when considering the sum of cash in banks, the
 banks' current accounts at the BCRA and reverse repurchase agreements for the BCRA, as a percentage

 36 tion period for minimum cash, established through
 34 Communication A 4858, was completed with a surplus in

 30 pesos. Both private and public banks concluded with a

 In the foreign currency segment, in mid-October, through
 Communication A 4851 a reduction in the minimum cash
 requirement was established. Such regulatory change
 aimed to provide entities with greater resources and in
 this way allow them to grant a larger amount of loans in

The interest rates of fixed-rate repos remained at the same levels as in October for both active and passive operations. In this way, the interest rates of passive repos remained at 10.5% and 11% for 1 and 7 days respectively, while

3 In this section the figures correspond to end-of-month data, except where otherwise specified.

Monetary Report | November 2008 | BCRA | 7

the interest rates of active repos for 1 and 7 days were located at 12.5% and 13% respectively.

On the other hand, the average stock of passive repos for the BCRA rose slightly compared to the average in October and, in this way, considering all the modalities in which this Institution operates (REPO round, overnight operations and Investment Funds), it was located at $9,090 million, $139 million above that recorded in October. For its part, the average stock of active repos reached $26 million, $40 million below the level recorded in October.

It is worth mentioning that as a demonstration of this Institution's willingness to provide resources if necessary, in mid-November, through Communication B 9404, an increase in the available limit for the granting of active repos at fixed rates was ordered, increasing it to $10,000 million (vs. $3,000 million in effect until then) for the total number of entities.

During November, the context of high volatility in international and local financial markets continued. However, in the case of local markets, behavior was not uniform throughout the month, distinguishing two periods, the first until November 10, and the second from that date onwards where volatility of local monetary and financial variables began to decrease. In this context, the interest rate of interbank loans (call) for operations on a 1 business day basis averaged 16.1%, with an increase of almost 1.8 p.p. compared to the end of October. From that date, the call interest rate began to decrease, although with a slight rise on the last business day, closing the month at 12.77%, 1.47 p.p. less than on October 31 (see Graph 5.3).

Regarding the average evolution during the month, the interbank interest rate for operations on a 1 business day basis increased in November by 1.56 p.p., with the average rate for the month being 13.52%. The amounts traded which in October had reached the minimum of the last three years (daily average of $600 million), increased slightly in November to $730 million.

In addition to the higher average value, it could also be seen during the month that the increase in dispersion between the interest rates agreed each day with respect to the average of each day continued (see Graph 5.4). The standard deviation of the interest rates of operations agreed for 1 day was in November almost double that of the previous month, due, in part, to the greater weight that NFIs have acquired among market participants.

Finally, the interest rates for longer-term financing also registered increases. In the case of the interest rate on mortgage loans, it reached an average monthly rate of 16.3%, with an increase of 2.9 p.p. compared to the level observed in October. It should be noted that this interest rate refers to operations agreed at fixed interest rate or renegotiable rates and does not include those agreed at variable rates. On the other hand, the interest rate corresponding to financing with chattel mortgage guarantee was placed at 21.7%, with a monthly increase of 2.5 p.p..

## 6. International Reserves and Foreign Exchange Market

The stock of international reserves increased by US$1,130 million, reaching a total of US$46,072 million (see Chart 6.1). The BCRA was a net buyer of foreign currency in the Unified and Free Foreign Exchange Market (MULC) for an amount of US$521 million. To this behavior was added the increase in the current account in dollars of financial entities at the BCRA, as a counterpart to funds from the AFJPs that were deposited in the local financial system.

In November the peso depreciated again against the Dollar. In effect, the increase in the wholesale dollar (Reference) quotation was 8%, with its average price at 3.33 $/US$ (see Chart 6.2). For its part, the peso appreciated 4.3% against the euro (less than the appreciation in October), recording an average quotation of 4.24 $/euro. Finally, the appreciation of the peso in relation to the real was 14.5% (also less than the appreciation in October), since the average monthly quotation was 1.47 $/real.

During the month of November the extremely high level of volatility in stock markets continued. When calculating historical volatility, a decrease was observed compared to October (Chart 7.1). In contrast, the VIX, which measures the expected volatility of the S&P, averaged 62.6% in November, 1.4 p.p. more than the previous month. It should be noted that for the second consecutive month the VIX reaches a historical record.

In this context of high volatility there were mixed results in stock market indices measured in their original currency, with the contrast to October notable where there had been sharp declines in the stock exchanges. The largest decline—of a series of selected indices—was observed in the American S&P (7.5%), followed by Chile's IGPA (2.5%), and BOVESPA (Brazil, 1.8%). The largest gain was in the Shanghai index 8.2%, which was followed by Peru's IGBVL index 5%, and finally MEXBOL (Mexico) 0.4%.

The evolution of stock market indices by region according to the MSCI (measured in US$) showed considerably smaller losses than those observed in October. The global MSCI lost 6.7%, Europe's lost 6.9%, Latin America's lost 6.7% and Japan's lost 1.2% (Chart 7.2).

# Performance of World Stock Indices

While the financial indicators for November were not as dramatic as those of October, the central banks and treasuries of the main economies were very active in dealing with the crisis affecting the global financial system and the recession that is now official in much of the G7 members.

In Argentina during November, the MERVAL index - measured in pesos - registered a loss of 1.7%, reaching a value of 994 points at the end of the month. In the last twelve months, the MERVAL obtained negative returns of 55%, and so far this year it is also losing value by 54%.

Measured in dollars, all the stock exchanges in the region had negative results in November, except for the IGBVL (Peru) which rose 4.1%. The BOVESPA index leads the stock exchanges with a negative result by falling 8.8%, followed by the IPC (Mexico) which lost 4.2%, the MERVAL which showed a negative variation of 1.3%, and the IGPA of Chile which varied -1.2%.

Volatility in Latin American stock exchanges was reduced. In the specific case of MERVAL volatility - 18 trading sessions - in annualized terms and measured in dollars it was 66 in November, a value similar to that of September and one of the highest values in the series, despite having fallen 31 p.p. compared to the previous month.

The average daily trading volumes on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange decreased compared to October by $40 million. Thus the average amount traded in November reached $66 million daily.

## Fixed Income

Although volatility in financial markets was lower, during November the process of reduction in speculative borrowing continued, which began in September, with the corresponding greater demand for lower risk assets (chart 7.3). In this sense, the EMBI+ which measures the spreads of emerging countries increased 256 b.p.. In the case of the spread of Latin American external debt, it also increased by 85 b.p., that of Brazil increased by 40 b.p., it should be noted that Argentina's spread decreased by 65 b.p.. In the case of Credit Default Swaps (CDS) spreads, Argentina's 5-year spread increased by 331 b.p., while Brazil's 5-year CDS spread decreased by 51 b.p. in the month of November compared to October.

The volume of public securities traded (on average daily) in November continued the downward trend reaching $433 million, with a reduction compared to October of $1,466 million (-77%).

In the month of November, only one negotiable bond was issued corresponding to Tarjetas Cuyanas S.A. for an amount of u$s 11,522,900, at a rate of 14% annual and with a maturity of one year.

Observing their structure, the segment of money market
funds registered a significant increase, explained by the
greater quantity of quotas. In this way, it closed the

Financial Trust Funds6

The issuances of financial trust funds in November
totaled $962 million (see Chart 7.5), 8% more compared
to the previous month and 16% more compared to
November 2007, approaching in this way the total
securitized in July ($1,043 million), maximum value
Chart 7.6 registered since the beginning of the year. As for the
Underlying Assets quantity of placements, a total of 23 was registered, which
million $ (November 2008, October 2008 and November 2007) meant 6 issuances more compared to October although

The interest rates at maturity of the senior securities presented dissimilar behavior depending on whether they were fixed or variable rate issuances, which was related to the different distribution in the month of each type of placement. In this sense, placements at variable rate concentrated mainly in the second part of the month (when money market interest rates began to decline) corresponding with lower rates than those of the first fortnight (see Chart 7.8). Meanwhile, fixed rate issuances, although they were distributed throughout the month in a homogeneous manner, were those agreed upon in the first half of the month that pushed the weighted average upward. In effect, the weighted average rate by amount of the three placements awarded through November 14 amounted to 28.3% while that of the two remaining issuances corresponding to the second part of the month was 3 p.p. lower.

In this way, when calculating the weighted average by amount, senior securities agreed at fixed rate reached 27% (+7.8 p.p. compared to the previous month), surpassing the previous maximum of 20% in September 2007, while variable rate issuances declined 1.2 p.p. compared to October to stand at 25.1%.

The weighted average duration by amount of FF senior securities issued stood at 4.8 months (a level similar to that of FF with personal loans as underlying assets), declining 0.6 p.p. compared to October.
