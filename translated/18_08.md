1. Summary¹
• At the scheduled meeting on August 7, the Monetary Policy Committee (COPOM) of the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (BCRA) decided to define the rate of Liquidity Bills (LELIQ) at 7 days as the new monetary policy rate and set it at 40%. Subsequently, in response to the volatility observed in the foreign exchange market and the risk it implies in terms of a greater impact on local inflation, the BCRA's COPOM decided to meet outside its pre-established schedule on two other occasions, on August 13 and 30. On these occasions, it increased the monetary policy rate first to 45% and subsequently to 60%.

• Interest rates in the interbank loan markets aligned with the new value of the monetary policy rate by month-end: the interest rate for call operations at 1 business day ended August at 57.25%, while the interest rate for current account advances of more than $10 million and up to 7 days to companies ended August at 61.7%. Passive rates also showed increases following the last increase in the monetary policy rate: the TM20 of private banks ended the month at 40.5% and the BADLAR of private banks at 39.4%; in both cases more than 4 p.p. above the levels that averaged in the first 30 days of August.

• As had been announced, in August the implementation of the gradual reduction plan for the LEBAC stock began. For this purpose, a series of measures were implemented: in the LEBAC auction the BCRA began to offer an amount lower than maturity, which can only be subscribed by purchasers that are not financial entities; these can only buy LEBAC in the primary market on behalf of third parties and cannot sell their remaining holdings to counterparties that are not banks in the secondary market; financial entities are offered as options for placing their liquidity BCRA Notes (NOBAC) and LELIQ. In turn, as an alternative investment in pesos, the Ministry of Finance began to auction bills in pesos on the LEBAC maturity dates. The proceeds are deposited by the Treasury in public banks, which in turn transfer them to the BCRA to integrate reserve requirements and acquire LELIQ.

• Thus, following the maturity of LEBAC, it was observed that part of the funds not renewed by holders that are not financial entities went to increase deposits, both from the public sector, due to the placement of LETES, and from the private sector. As a result, fixed-term deposits in pesos from the private sector grew both in nominal and real terms and private M3 accumulated nominal growth of 25.6% in the last 12 months. However, private M2 continued to decelerate, and reached nominal year-on-year growth of 20%, mainly due to the evolution of currency in public circulation.

• As of August 16, an increase of 3 p.p. in the reserve requirement coefficients in pesos was implemented for financial entities with larger assets. This increase must be integrated through higher balances in current accounts. Thus, part of the decrease in LEBAC and the growth of deposits in pesos from financial entities had as a counterpart the increase in current accounts in pesos at the BCRA. At the end of August, another increase in the reserve requirement coefficients in pesos was defined for the same group of financial entities, of 5 p.p., which becomes effective as of September and can be integrated indifferently with balances in current account at the BCRA, NOBAC or LELIQ.

• In the local currency segment, loans declined 0.8% in August when considering balances in real and seasonally adjusted terms, with decreases in most credit lines. Real year-on-year growth stood at 10.9%. In nominal terms they grew 0.8% supported by lines related to consumption –personal and credit cards– and mortgages.

• Because the growth of deposits far exceeded that of loans, in August...
increased by 2 percentage points the banking liquidity in pesos up to 45.7% of deposits. In turn, the measures implemented with respect to the allocation of LEBACs and reserve requirement provisions caused its composition to change, in favor of mandatory components –current accounts mainly– and to the detriment of securities issued by the BCRA –with substitution of LEBACs for LELIQs–.

 2. Interest Rates2

 Monetary Policy Interest Rates

 In the scheduled meeting in August, the Monetary Policy
 Committee (COPOM) of the Central Bank of the Argentine
 Republic (BCRA) resolved to define the 7-day Liquidity
 Bills rate (LELIQ) as the new monetary policy rate and set
 Chart 2.1 it at 40%3, a level that remained in effect until the 12th.
 Subsequently, on the 13th and 30th of August, in response
 to exchange rate volatility and the risk it implies in terms
 of a greater impact on local inflation, COPOM resolved to
 meet outside its pre-established schedule and increase the
 monetary policy rate to 45% and 60%, respectively (see
 Chart 2.1). Likewise, to guarantee the contractionary bias
 of monetary conditions, it committed to not reduce the new
 value of its monetary policy rate at least until December.

 In August, the BCRA also announced a new component in
 the strategy of reordering the instruments with which it
 implements its monetary policy: the gradual elimination of
 the existing stock of LEBAC. To achieve this, a series of
 measures began to be implemented: in each auction, the
 BCRA offers an amount of LEBAC lower than the maturity,
 which can only be subscribed by holders that are not finan-
 cial entities; these can only purchase LEBAC in the primary
 Chart 2.2 market on behalf of third parties and cannot sell their re-
 maining holdings to counterparties that are not banks in
 the secondary market; financial entities are offered as
 options to place their liquidity the BCRA Notes (NOBAC)
 and LELIQ. In turn, as an alternative investment in pesos,
 the Ministry of Finance began to auction bills in pesos on
 the maturity dates of LEBAC. The amount collected is
 deposited by the Treasury in public banks, which in turn
 transfer it to the BCRA to contribute to reserves and ac-
 quire LELIQ. The BCRA committed to ensuring the supply
 of dollars to guarantee the proper functioning of the for-
 eign exchange market.

 Thus, during August the BCRA gradually withdrew from its
 seller position in the secondary LEBAC market, completing
 net purchases for VN $17.1 billion and in the primary auc-
 tion generated a monetary expansion, which freed funds
 from both financial entities and other holders. In the first
 case, the resources were allocated mainly to LELIQ, while
 the rest supported the increase in deposits (see Monetary
 Aggregates section)

2 The interest rates referenced in this section are expressed as annual nominal rates (TNA).

 Market Interest Rates

 During August, the interest rates in the interbank loan
 markets experienced some volatility during the first half of
 the month, to later stabilize at values close to the monetary
 policy rate after the release of funds associated with the
 partial renewal of LEBAC maturity, and finally register an
 increase in the last two days of the month as a result of the
 Chart 2.3 change in the monetary policy rate (see Chart 2.1). The in-
 terest rate for 1 business day call operations ended August
 at 57.25%, 18.3 p.p. above the value recorded at the end of
 the previous month. For its part, the average interest rate
 for 1 business day operations between financial entities in
 the guaranteed market (REPO round) stood at month-end
 at 50.9%, showing an increase of 12.7 p.p. compared to
 the end of July (see Chart 2.2). The average daily amount
 traded in both markets decreased $4,850 million, totaling
 approximately $14,000 million.
The interest rate on current account advances of more than $10 million and up to 7 days for companies showed an average monthly decline of 1 p.p., reaching 49.9%. However, as a result of an increase in the last two days of the month, it ended at 61.7% (compared to 43% at the close of July).

Chart 2.4 In the segment of fixed-rate operations, passive interest rates remained relatively stable for most of the month and increased following the rise in the monetary policy rate defined on August 30th. The TM20 rate – interest rate for fixed-term deposits of $20 million or more, 30 to 35 days maturity – of private banks averaged 36.5% in August, ending the month at 40.5%. Meanwhile, the BADLAR – interest rate for fixed-term deposits of $1 million or more, 30 to 35 days maturity – of private banks averaged 35.2% throughout the month (versus 34.5% average for July). However, as a result of an acceleration at the close of the month, August ended at 39.4%, exhibiting an increase of 4.25 p.p. with respect to the close of the previous month. In the retail segment, the interest rate paid for fixed-term deposits of up to $100 thousand and up to 35 days averaged 31.12% throughout the month (an increase of 0.6 p.p. with respect to July), and ended the month at 33.5%, resulting 2.9 p.p. above the level at the end of last month (see Chart 2.3).

Active interest rates showed mixed behavior in August, although in general they accumulated increases with respect to July. The interest rate on personal loans averaged 48.6%, exhibiting an increase of 1.8 p.p. With regard to interest rates on lines intended to finance business activity,

Monetary Report | August 2018 | BCRA | 5

the rate charged for single-signature documents averaged Chart 2.5 41.4%, showing an increase of 1.8 p.p.; while the interest rate on discounted documents averaged 40.7%, showing an increase of 0.3 p.p., although it was the one that reacted the most to the last increase in the monetary policy rate at the close of the month (see Chart 2.4).

With regard to financings adjustable by UVA, mortgage loans were granted at a weighted average interest rate by amount of 6.1%, similar to that observed in the previous month. Meanwhile, the interest rate on personal loans denominated in UVA averaged 13.9%, showing a slight decline of 0.2% (see Chart 2.5).

For its part, the interest rates paid on time deposits adjustable by UVA had different trajectories depending on the term of the operations. The rate paid on Chart 3.1 90-day deposits averaged 4.1% in August (same level as the previous month), while the rate paid on deposits around 180 days reached 4.2%, showing a decline of 0.2 p.p.

3. Monetary Aggregates¹

As it had announced, in August the BCRA began the gradual process of reducing the stock of LEBAC. In this month's auction it set a maximum amount of VN $230 billion for the placement of LEBAC to holders that were not financial entities, VN $70 billion below the maturity that these holders concentrated. Financial entities were excluded from among potential LEBAC buyers and, in addition to the other instruments already available, they were offered the possibility of placing their excess liquidity in BCRA Notes (NOBAC).
## Chart 3.2

The funds released by the partial renewal of the maturity of LEBACs held by non-financial entities were allocated to the foreign exchange market and to increase deposits in pesos, both from the private sector and from the public sector, the latter originating from the subscription of National Treasury bills. In turn, the growth of these deposits and the increase in reserve requirement ratios (see Section Liquidity of financial entities) implied an increase in the monetary base due to greater demand for bank reserves (see Chart 3.1).

The monetary base showed monthly growth of 7.8%, while the increase in the broad monetary base (which includes LEBAC holdings and reverse repurchase agreements of financial entities, and LELIQs) reached 4.1%, accompanying the increase recorded by the broad monetary aggregate (M3).

In terms of Private M3⁴ this meant an increase driven by deposits that reached 1.4%, accumulating in the last twelve months an increase of 25.6%.

For its part, currency in circulation held by the public decreased, so Private M2⁵ presented in August a nominal decline of 0.5%, and a year-on-year variation of 20.1%.

When considering balances in real terms⁶ and adjusted for seasonality, in the month private M2 decreased 0.6%, while fixed-term deposits in pesos of the sector grew 2.9%. In total, the balance of private M3 increased 0.6% (see Chart 3.2).

Deposits in pesos from the private sector registered an average monthly growth of 2.6% in nominal terms, driven by the increase in sight placements and, fundamentally, by those agreed for fixed terms. The latter grew 5.1%, with an acceleration in deposits of more than $1 million (see Chart 3.3), which reflected the capture of part of the funds released following the maturity of LEBACs. For its part, public sector deposits increased 11.7%, driven by the placement of National Treasury debt, with which the total of deposits in pesos presented a monthly increase of 5.4%.

## Chart 3.4

In the foreign currency segment, the total balance of deposits ended August at US$31,800 million, with increases in both public sector and private sector placements. The latter grew US$460 million in August, presenting a decrease in the last days of the month (see Chart 3.4).

## 4. Loans

In real terms⁸ and adjusted for seasonality, loans to the private sector left behind the growing trend they had shown until the first part of the year. In the local currency segment, loans declined 0.8% in August, with decreases in financing instruments through documents, pawn loans and personal loans. Real year-on-year growth

4 Includes currency in circulation held by the public and deposits in pesos from the private sector.
5 Includes currency in circulation held by the public and sight deposits in pesos from the private sector.
6 Real values were calculated using core inflation indices: the National CPI series from INDEC was used from January 2017, between May 2016 and December 2016 the GBA CPI from INDEC was used, and between July 2012 and December 2015 the CPI from the City of Buenos Aires was used, base jul-11/jun-12.
7 Monthly variations in loans are adjusted for accounting movements, fundamentally caused by transfers of credits in the portfolio of entities to financial trusts. In this report, "amounts granted" or "new loans" are understood as loans (new and renewals) arranged in a period. In contrast, the variation in balance is composed of loans arranged, minus amortizations and cancellations for the period.

stood at 10.9% (see Chart 4.1). Total loans in pesos and foreign currency showed a monthly increase of 1%, with a year-on-year variation of 19%. However, this figure includes the impact of the depreciation of the peso against the dollar observed in the month (see section International Reserves and Foreign Exchange Market).

In the peso segment, among financings destined mainly to finance companies, advances grew 0.4% in real terms and adjusted for seasonality, while in nominal terms they showed an increase of 1.3%. Thus, over the last twelve months they accumulated a nominal increase of 59.5%. For their part, financings arranged through documents continued showing a downward trend (see Chart 4.2). Adjusted for inflation and seasonality they declined 3.8% and in nominal terms decreased 1.4% in the month. Their year-on-year growth
stood at around 18%, 6.5 p.p. less than in July.

With regard to loans with real guarantees, mortgages showed an increase of 0.6% in real terms and adjusted for seasonality. In this way, after the depreciation of the peso against the dollar in recent months, mortgage loans maintain their balance relatively stable (see Chart 4.3). In nominal terms, they grew 2.2% and year-on-year variation stood at 139.6%. Financing in UVA continued to represent around 90% of loans to individuals, with an average daily amount of $230 million granted in August, similar to July and markedly below the $700 million in April. For their part, loans with chattel mortgage guarantee showed in August a decline of 2% adjusted for inflation and without seasonality. In nominal terms, they remained relatively stable throughout the month, while over the last twelve months
they accumulated an increase close to 37%.

Regarding loans destined mainly for families, credit card financings grew in the month 0.8% in real terms and without seasonality. The nominal increase was 1.6% in August, showing a year-on-year variation of 38.4%. For their part, personal loans showed a decrease of 0.9% in real terms and adjusted for seasonality. Meanwhile, their nominal growth was 1.4% in August, with a year-on-year increase of 42.2%.

Thus, in nominal terms, loans in pesos to the private sector continued decelerating its growth rate, with a monthly variation of 0.8% and 43.8% year-on-year.

Monetary Report | August 2018 | BCRA | 8
Finally, dollar loans to the private sector showed an increase of 1.1% (US$175 million), which was composed of both those granted through single signature documents (mainly export pre-financing) and credit card financing. Thus, the monthly average balance stood at US$16,400 million, returning to a level similar to that of June.

## 5. Liquidity of financial entities

In August, two reserve requirement increases were implemented. In the first instance⁹, an increase of 3 percentage points was established for financial entities with the largest amount of assets, included in group "A"¹⁰, which must be fully integrated into the current accounts of entities at the Central Bank. In the second instance¹¹, an increase of 5 additional percentage points was implemented, which may be integrated into current accounts or through LELIQ or NOBAC. The last increase will be in effect as of September.

As a result, financial entities increased their liquidity maintained in current account balances and, given the impossibility of subscribing to LEBAC, they decided to channel part of their excess resources toward LELIQ. In addition to this change in composition, because the increase in deposits exceeded the increase in loans, the liquidity in pesos of financial entities (measured as the sum of cash in banks, the current account of entities at the Central Bank, holdings of public securities for integration of the minimum cash regime, net repos with that entity, and holdings of LEBAC and LELIQ, as a percentage of deposits in pesos) registered an increase of 2 percentage points in the month, averaging 45.7% for the month (see Chart 5.1).

On the other hand, liquidity in foreign currency (sum of cash in banks, the current account of entities at the Central Bank, as a percentage of dollar deposits) registered an increase of 0.2 percentage points compared to the previous month (50.4% of deposits), explained by the increase in the dollar current account at the Central Bank.

## 6. International reserves and foreign exchange market

During the first days of August, the Ministry of Finance auctioned a total of US$475 million of funds that the IMF had disbursed in June. On the other hand, the BCRA sold foreign currency to the private sector, for a total of US$2,544 million. 60% of the BCRA's spot market foreign currency sales were concentrated in the last week of August, when volatility increased in emerging markets (see Chart 6.1, which does not include foreign currency auctioned by the Ministry of Finance).

The BCRA's dollar sales added to the net foreign currency debt payments of the national government explained the decline in international reserves experienced in the month. Thus, August ended with a balance of US$52,658 million, which implied a decrease of US$5,338 million compared to the previous month (see Chart 6.2).

The peso/US dollar exchange rate ended August at 37.125, registering an increase of 35.8% with respect to the level reached the previous month. Regarding the real exchange rate, it should be noted that it exceeded the maximum reached following the exit from the exchange rate controls in March 2016, and reached values that had not been observed since the end of 2008. During August, it registered an increase of 27.4% (see Chart 6.3). With respect to exchange rate policy, the monetary authority maintains the floating exchange rate scheme that allows for the absorption of shocks (especially of external origin), with the possibility that the Central Bank may conduct interventions to moderate disruptive movements in the foreign exchange market that could affect financial stability or the disinflation path.
