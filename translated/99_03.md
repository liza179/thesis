# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information
Communication Nº 33.775

During February the monetary market showed favorable behavior, reflected in an increase in deposits and loans. Deposits increased in the month 0.6% driven by the strong increase in fixed-term deposits in foreign currency. Likewise, there was a reduction in the holding of means of payment in pesos that was due to seasonal reasons, which in turn determined a slight fall in the level of international reserves of the financial system. On the other hand, accompanying the evolution of deposits, loans to the non-financial private sector increased on average 0.8% accumulating 2.9% growth in the year.

The improved liquidity conditions in the monetary market together with the fall in sovereign risk were reflected in a widespread reduction in interest rates. For its part, financial entities as a whole increased their integration of minimum liquidity requirements by 3.5%, which in this way reached 21.7% of deposits (0.5 percentage points more than in January).

Loans and deposits of private banks registered during December strong growth rates: 2.5% and 1.8%, respectively. The assets of private banks decreased 6.7% fundamentally as a consequence of the strong fall in repo operations, forward and spot settlement of financial assets.

With regard to the composition of loans to the non-financial sector, it is worth highlighting the recovery of advances (3.0%) and personal loans (4.9%).

Among the alternative sources of funding for private banking, the reduction in the balance of foreign loan lines stands out (due to cancellation of some credits that were requested during the crisis in Russia), and the increase in interbank obligations (which had been significantly depressed in October and November) and subordinated debt.

In December, private banks registered losses of 7.2% (in annualized terms) of their net equity, explained by an increase in administration expenses, a low level of income from asset holdings and an increase in miscellaneous losses.

The credit portfolio quality of private banks showed a recovery in December, after having registered a continuous but slight deterioration starting in August. The gross irregularity indicator, that is, irregular portfolio in terms of financing, fell from 7.0% in November to 6.8% in December, as a consequence of both a fall in irregular portfolio -because an important amount of uncollectible credits was written off from assets - and a strong increase in financing.

The integration of capital for credit risk in terms of assets weighted by risk according to the Basel criterion grew slightly reaching 17.1%, that is, well above the 8% internationally recommended.

(1) At 30 days.
(2) Corresponds to fixed-term deposits for amounts of one million pesos or more. Between September and December 1998, the interest rate corresponds to depo-
 sits agreed between 30 and 59 days; as of January 1999, for deposits between 30 and 35 days.
(3) The Banks Index is a capitalization index constructed with the same methodology as Burcap. It includes shares of the banks: Galicia,
 Francés, Bansud, Supervielle, Suquía and Río de la Plata.
(4) The sovereign risk premium is measured as the difference between the yield of the FRB and a U.S. government bond of equal duration.
(5) Currency risk is measured as the difference between the yield of Consolidation Bonds (BOCONES) Pro1 in pesos and Pro2 in dol-
 lars, which allow separating the exposure of the local currency by having the same duration and identical sovereign and interest rate risk.
