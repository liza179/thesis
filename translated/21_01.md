On the use of inclusive language in this publication

The use of language that does not discriminate and that allows all gender identities to be made visible is an institutional commitment of the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic. In turn, those of us who have prepared this publication recognize the influence of language on ideas, feelings, ways of thinking and value systems.

In this document, an effort has been made to avoid sexist and binary language. However, in order to facilitate reading, resources such as "@" or "x" are not included.

## 1. Summary

In January, the broad monetary aggregate M3 private would have registered, in real terms and adjusted for seasonality, a slight increase (0.6%), after three consecutive months of presenting negative variations. Within it, time deposits were the ones that made a positive contribution to the monthly variation, more than offsetting the negative contribution of means of payment.

The monthly growth of time deposits was 8.1% nominal, which would be equivalent to an expansion of 4.4% in real terms and without seasonality. In this way, they began the year with an annual expansion rate at constant prices close to 25% which, while implying a deceleration with respect to the historical maximum reached in October, continues to be positioned above the maximum reached in the 2004-2019 period.

The increase in time deposits was composed of both wholesale placements and those of less than $1 million. The latter showed a growing trend again, after three months of remaining stable. Deposits denominated in UVA also showed greater dynamism, which in January accumulated an increase close to $11,100 million.

In nominal terms and without seasonality, loans in pesos to the private sector would have registered a monthly increase of 3.7% in January. In real terms, the balance of loans to the private sector would be showing annual growth of 8.4%. The monthly expansion of loans in pesos was explained mainly by the evolution of commercial lines and credit card financing. With respect to the latter, the BCRA ordered maintaining the maximum rate of 43% annual rate for financing of outstanding credit card balances up to $200,000 per issued card.

Commercial credit was channeled mainly through the Line of Financing for Productive Investment (LFIP) to SMEs. At the end of January, loans have been granted for approximately a total of $240,550 million, 44% more compared to the end of December. As for the destination of these funds, approximately 83% of the total disbursed corresponds to the financing of working capital and the rest to the line that finances investment projects.

The Central Bank was once again a net buyer of foreign currency in January. This, added to the increase in the current account of financial entities at the BCRA, exceeded the decline associated with net payments to international organizations. Thus, the balance of International Reserves accumulated an increase of US$105 million with respect to the close of the previous month, ending January at US$39,515 million.

## 2. Monetary aggregates
The broad monetary aggregate M3 private¹ would have registered, in real terms² and adjusted for seasonality, a slight increase (0.6%) in January, after three consecutive months of presenting negative variations (see Graph 2.1). Within it, time deposits were those that made the positive contribution to the month's variation, more than compensating for the negative contribution of means of payment (currency in circulation and demand deposits).

The monthly growth of time deposits was 8.1% nominal, which would be equivalent to an expansion of 4.4% in real terms, the largest of the last five months. Thus, time deposits began the year with an year-over-year growth rate at constant prices close to 25% which, although it implied a deceleration with respect to the historical maximum reached in October, continued to be positioned above the maximum reached in the 2004-2019 period (see Graph 2.2).

(var. of monthly average balances at constant prices)

Between means of payment, currency in circulation continued showing a sustained downward trend, registering a fall of 1.5% adjusted for seasonality and at constant prices. A similar variation was registered by demand deposits, reducing the previous month's decline.

In the dollar segment, with seasonal factors dissipated, private sector deposits stopped growing. The balance was located at the close of the month at US$ 15,645 million, around US$ 300 million below the value observed at the end of December.

Breaking down the balance by amount stratum, the month's increase was composed of both wholesale placements and those of less than $1 million (see Graph 2.3). The latter showed a growing trend again, after three months of remaining stable. Deposits denominated in UVA also showed greater dynamism. In January, they increased by $11,100 million and, although placements with early cancellation option showed an increase, growth was explained largely by traditional deposits (see Graph 2.4). For their part, deposits tied to the dollar value (DIVA dollar), which are available for the agricultural sector, remained mostly stable.

Finally, the Monetary Base exhibited, on average, a monthly increase of 6.5% ($156,500 million), which was explained, in large part, by the positive "statistical carryover" left by December, a month with strong positive seasonality. In effect, the variation at the tip — between December 31 and January 31 — was only 0.4% ($11,050 million; see Graph 2.5).

 Monthly Monetary Report | January 2021 | BCRA | 43. Loans to the private sector

In January, loans in pesos to the private sector registered a monthly increase of 3.7%, considering nominal values and without seasonality. Thus, in the last twelve months they accumulated growth of 52.7% (see Graph 3.1). The monthly expansion of loans in pesos was explained mainly by the evolution of commercial lines and financing with credit cards (see Graph 3.2). In real terms, the balance of loans to the private sector would have remained stable, with year-on-year growth of 8.4%.

As a whole, commercial lines grew in the month 4.8% nominal without seasonality (1.2% at constant prices), accumulating, compared to the same month of the previous year an increase of 92.2% (36.4% at constant prices; see Graph 3.3). Within this type of financing, current account advances became the line with the greatest growth, exhibiting a monthly average increase of 8.3% w.s. Meanwhile, discounted documents and single-signature documents registered increases of 3.9% and 3.6% w.s. respectively in the month.

Since its implementation, the Productive Investment Financing Line (LFIP) was the vehicle used to channel commercial credit to SMEs. As of the end of January, loans totaling approximately $240,550 million have been granted, 44% more compared to the end of December. As for the destination of these funds, around 83% of the total disbursed corresponds to working capital financing and the rest to the line that finances investment projects (see Graph 3.4). The number of companies that accessed these lines rose to 69,970, representing 30% more compared to the previous month.

Simultaneously, financing lines at subsidized rates that had been included within the "Emergency Assistance Program for Work and Production" (ATP) continued to be granted, which have accumulated, at the end of January, disbursements totaling $13,642 million, reaching more than 570,000 workers. In the latest version of the line, it was established that these were to be destined for the payment of salaries for companies with up to 800 employees, whose billing had shown year-on-year growth of between 0% and 35%, and also for those companies that provided non-critical activities, whose year-on-year nominal billing had been negative, regardless of the number of employees³.

Among loans associated with consumption, credit card financing registered a nominal expansion of 5% s.a. in the month, higher than that of the previous month (see Chart 3.5). This would imply, in real terms, a monthly variation equivalent to 1.4%. It should be noted that the BCRA decided to maintain the maximum rate of 43% p.a. for the financing of unpaid credit card balances up to $200,000 per card issued. Financial institutions may, for balances to be financed from $200,000 onwards, apply a differential rate up to the maximum permitted by the Credit Card Law, established at 25% more than the rate they receive for personal loans, and similar to those applied by non-bank cards⁴. For their part, personal loans increased in nominal terms by 2.3% s.a., although in real terms it would imply a decline of 1.1%.

With respect to lines with real guarantees, pawn loans exhibited in January a monthly increase of 6.1% in nominal terms and without seasonality, accumulating eight consecutive months of positive variation (see Chart 3.6). In real terms, the expansion would have been 2.5%, moderating its year-on-year decline to approximately 0.3%. Meanwhile, the balance of mortgage loans, in nominal terms, continues at the levels of the end of 2018.

³ The interest rate for non-critical sectors with nominal contraction of billing is 27% p.a., while for the rest it is 33% p.a.

Finally, loans in foreign currency to the private sector continued to decline. The average monthly decline was 3.6% (US$190 million), accumulating a contraction of 48.7% compared to January last year. This was due almost entirely to what happened with those granted through documents on a signature alone.

4. Liquidity of financial entities

Broad banking liquidity in local currency⁵ averaged 62% of deposits during the month, remaining practically unchanged with respect to the end of December (see chart 4.1). In this way it continues to be positioned at historically elevated levels.

Regarding the components of banking liquidity, a greater participation of current accounts at the Central Bank was verified, which registered an increase of 0.9 percentage points of deposits. Within remunerated liabilities, the LELIQ balance remained practically unchanged in terms of deposits, while reverse repos expressed a decline of 0.9 p.p. For its part, cash in banks as a percentage of deposits remained at the values of the previous months.
Bank liquidity in foreign currency registered a new increase, averaging 79.5% of its deposits in January. Among its components, around 60% of deposits are found in current accounts of financial entities at the BCRA, a percentage that has been decreasing since last October, with cash in banks gaining participation (see Graph 4.2).

5 Includes current accounts at the BCRA, cash in banks, balances of repos arranged with the BCRA, holdings of LELIQ and eligible bonds to integrate reserve requirements.

## 5. Interest Rates

Passive interest rates remained around the minimum guaranteed rates, which since mid-November are located at 37% (44% e.a.) for fixed-term placements by individuals of up to $1 million and at 34.2% (40% e.a.) for the rest of deposits (see Graph 5.1). For its part, interbank market interest rates presented limited variations throughout the month and were located, on average, at levels similar to those of December (the 1-day call rate averaged 30.3% and the repo between third parties was 32.8%).

In the same line, active interest rates remained stable. Financing instrumentalized through documents continued to be located at values close to those stipulated in the framework of the LFIP. Thus, the interest rate corresponding to the discount of documents averaged 33.1%, while the interest rate on documents with only signature was located, on average, at 34.7% (see Graph 5.2). For its part, the interest rate on advances remained stable throughout the month, interrupting the upward trend observed since early October and, in this way, averaged 39.4%. Finally, the interest rate charged for personal loans showed an increase during the first half of January, which was later reversed in the second part of the month. On average it was located at 56.4%, increasing 1 percentage point with respect to December.

Monthly Monetary Report | January 2021 | BCRA | 8 6. International Reserves
Like in December 2020, the Central Bank became a net buyer of foreign currency again, in this case for US$157 million. This, added to the increase in the current account of financial entities at the BCRA, exceeded the decline associated with net payments to international organizations. Thus, the balance of International Reserves accumulated an increase of US$105 million compared to the close of the previous month, ending January at US$39,515 million (see Graph 6.1).

The nominal peso/US dollar exchange rate increased 3.8% between the end of December and the end of January, concluding the month at a value of 87.30. The multilateral real exchange rate, for its part, registered a slight appreciation closing the month at a value of 123. In this way, the MRER continues to be positioned at a competitive level, above the average for 2020 (see Graph 6.2).
