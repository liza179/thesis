# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information
 Communiqué No. 35382

## Monetary Situation (August 1999)

The average stock of deposits in August registered a slight increase with respect to July ($130
million). The increase was driven by deposits in foreign currency - placements in pesos showed
a decline as a consequence of the reduction in current account deposits from the public sector. A
slight decline in the demand for currency by the public was also verified, associated with seasonal
reasons. The lower demand for currency along with a decrease in the integration of minimum
liquidity requirements were reflected in a reduction of the international reserves of the financial
system. On the other hand, loans showed a decline of $260 million.

Interest rates, in general, presented average levels similar to those observed in July.

## Private Banks (June 1999)

The strong increase in deposit capture by private banks during the last days of June was used, in
principle, to moderately increase their holdings of liquid assets, increase the balance of loans to
the non-financial sector and make short-term placements in banks abroad. Likewise, a significant
increase in subordinated obligations was recorded and a strong, although transitory, decline in
external loan lines was verified.

The profitability of private banks in June (4.9%, annualized, in terms of net equity) was somewhat
higher than the average for the year. This better performance is explained by higher income from
holding financial assets and higher profits from permanent shareholdings in other companies.
Likewise, as is common in June due to the closing of accounts by some entities, charges for
uncollectible accounts registered a significant increase.

The delinquency of the credit portfolio of private banks registered a slight decline in June. The
irregular portfolio in terms of financings went from 7.3% in May to 7.2%. The improvement in
irregularity indicators was due exclusively to the increase in financings, since the irregular portfolio
remained constant.

The excess integration of capital for credit risk for private banks registered a slight increase in terms
of the requirement, reaching 30.3% in June. For its part, the integration of capital for credit risk
in terms of risk assets (calculated according to the Basel criterion) remained at 17.8%, that is,
more than double what is internationally recommended.

(1) At 30 days.
(2) Corresponds to fixed-term deposits for amounts of one million pesos or more. Between September and December 1998, the interest rate corresponds to deposits agreed between 30 and 59 days; from January 1999 onwards, for deposits between 30 and 35 days.
(3) The Banks Index is a capitalization index constructed using the same methodology as the Burcap. It includes shares of the banks: Galicia, Francés, Bansud, Supervielle, Suquía, Hipotecario and Río de la Plata.
(4) The sovereign risk premium is measured as the difference between the returns of the FRB and a U.S. government bond of equal duration.
(5) Currency risk is measured as the difference between the return of Consolidation Bonds (BOCONES) Pro1 in pesos and Pro 2 in dollars, which allow separating exposure of the local currency by having similar duration and interest rate risk, and identical sovereign risk.
