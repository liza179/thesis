July 2019

## 1. Summary

• In July there is a seasonal increase in the demand for transactional money due to the annual bonus and winter vacations, which this year were boosted by the long weekend on July 9th. To mitigate its impact on the rest of the monetary market variables, it was arranged that the integration of reserve requirement obligations in pesos be carried out considering July and August together.

• In line with the unified period to integrate Minimum Cash requirements, the Monetary Policy Committee (COPOM) of the BCRA decided to adapt to a two-month term the measurement of compliance with the Monetary Base (BM) target for July and August. The average target in the period remained unchanged at $1,343 billion. The average monthly balance of the BM stood at $1,381.5 billion in July, 3% above that recorded in June.

• Deposits in pesos from the private sector increased 2.9% in nominal terms with respect to June, with a growth of 1.9% in demand deposits and 3.9% in time deposits placements ($46,800 million). Thus, in real terms and adjusted for seasonality, an increase in fixed-term deposits was again observed (1.6%).

• In a context of downward inflation expectations, the LELIQ interest rate showed a decline until mid-July, which was partially reversed in the last days of the month, responding to the dynamics typical of pre-electoral periods. At the end of July the LELIQ interest rate stood at 60.4%.

• The interest rates paid on time deposits followed a similar trajectory to that of LELIQ. Their values continued to place them at positive levels in real terms. Thus, the rate for 30-day operations averaged 47.5% for the month (TNA) which, considering inflation expectations for the period, implied a real monthly effective rate of 1.5%, equivalent to an annual effective rate of 19.7%.

• In July, the nominal balance and seasonally adjusted loans in pesos to the private sector grew 0.7%, driven by those granted through account overdrafts and credit card financing.

• The balance of international reserves ended July at US$67,899 million, which implied an increase of US$3,621 million with respect to the previous month. Said increase was explained by the disbursement of the fifth installment of the stand-by program agreed with the IMF, which was partially offset by the net payment of foreign currency debt by the National Treasury.

The statistical closing of this report was August 6, 2019.

Monetary Report | July 2019 | BCRA | 12. Monetary Aggregates
In July, a seasonal increase in means of payment is observed (M2 private, which includes currency in circulation in the hands of the public and sight deposits in pesos from the private sector) that originates from the collection of the half-year annual supplementary payment (SAC) between the last days of June and the first days of July and winter vacations, which this year were boosted by the long weekend of July 9th. These factors imply an additional demand for currency and savings account deposits (see Graph 2.1). To mitigate the impact of the seasonal increase in demand for transactional money on the rest of the monetary market variables, it was arranged that the integration of reserve requirements in pesos be carried out considering the period covering the months of July and August jointly. 1

In line with the unified period for integrating Minimum Cash requirements, the Central Bank of Argentina's (BCRA) Monetary Policy Committee (COPOM) decided to adapt to a bimonthly deadline the measurement of compliance with the Monetary Base (BM) target for July and August. The average target in the period remained unchanged at $1,343 billion. 2

The average monthly balance of the BM was placed at $1,381.5 billion in July, 3% above that registered in June. The monthly increase was composed of an increase in monetary circulation. In particular, the monthly nominal increase in currency in the hands of the public reached 7% and is reduced to 3% when adjusted for the seasonal effect. Thus, in real and deseasonalized terms it grew 0.6% in July, slightly above the previous month (Graph 2.2).

Deposits in pesos from the private sector increased 2.9% in nominal terms compared to June, with an average monthly growth of 1.9% in sight deposits and 3.9% in fixed-term placements ($46,800 million). Thus, in real terms and adjusted for seasonality, a decline was again observed in the former (4.1%) and an increase in fixed-term deposits (1.6%). The growth in fixed-term deposits was again led by family placements, observing an acceleration in their growth during the days of SAC collection. In turn, fixed-term placements by companies again resumed an upward trend once the period in which they must face said payment passed (see Graph 2.3).

3. Passive interest rates and banking liquidity
To guarantee the contractionary nature of monetary policy, the COPOM decided to keep constant the minimum rate of Liquidity Bills (LELIQ) at 58% until mid-August, when the next inflation figure will be released.³ In a context of declining inflation expectations, the interest rate showed a decline until mid-July, which was partially reversed in the last days of the month, responding to the dynamics typical of pre-electoral periods. At the end of July, the LELIQ interest rate stood at 60.4%.

With the objective of improving the transmission of the LELIQ rate to the rates received by savers, it was decided to increase by 3 p.p. the fraction of reserve requirements for fixed-term deposits that financial entities are authorized to integrate with LELIQ, effective as of July.⁴ The interest rates paid for fixed-term deposits followed a similar trajectory to that of LELIQ (see Graph 3.1).⁵ Their values continued to be at positive levels in real terms. Thus, the rate for 30-day operations averaged 47.5% for the month (TNA) which, considering inflation expectations for the period, implied a real monthly effective rate of 1.5%, equivalent to an annual effective rate of 19.7%.

In terms of the composition of banking liquidity in pesos, the effect of the regulatory changes imposed on the Minimum Cash regime prevailed over the impact of the partial surplus accumulated by financial entities in the integration of reserve requirements in current accounts in the first month of the bimonthly period.⁶ Thus, an increase in the participation of LELIQ and a decrease in current accounts at the BCRA were observed. Broad liquidity in pesos increased by 3.5 p.p., averaging 64.6% of peso deposits for the month (see Graph 3.4), in a period in which deposit growth exceeded that of loans.⁷

## 4. Loans to the private sector and active interest rates

In July, the nominal and seasonally-adjusted balance of loans in pesos to the private sector grew 0.7% (see Graph 4.1), driven by those granted through account overdrafts and credit card financing.

The monthly growth of overdrafts was 3.2% in nominal terms and without seasonality. The increase concentrated during the first days of the month, in line with the greater liquidity needs of companies to pay the SAC. In

month an increase of 4.1% (nominal and adjusted by seasonality), accumulating in the last 12 months growth close to 18%. Part of this increase could be associated with an incipient increase in the use of credit cards following the relaunching of the Ahora 12 Program. For its part, the average monthly balance of personal loans remained almost unchanged compared to June, with an interest rate that averaged 65.9% in July, showing a decline of 1.1 percentage points.

of 0.6 percentage points compared to June, while the rate charged for pledged loans adjustable by UVA (46% of total pledged granted in July) remained stable and averaged 14.8% in July.

For its part, mortgages grew 0.1% monthly (in nominal terms and adjusted by seasonality). The granting in this segment is concentrated in operations adjustable by UVA, with rates that averaged 5.8% in the month.

In short, in real terms and adjusted by seasonality, loans in pesos to the private sector registered a monthly decline of 1.7%.

The balance of international reserves ended July at US$67,899 million, which implied an increase of US$3,621 million with respect to the previous month. Said increase was explained by the disbursement of the fifth installment of the stand-by program agreed with the IMF, which was partially offset by the net payment of foreign currency debt of the National Treasury.

During July the nominal peso/US dollar exchange rate remained within the exchange rate reference band. During the first part of the month it maintained the downward trend that it had been showing since the previous month and during the second half of the month it partially reversed it. Thus, it ended July at $43.87, 3.3% above the level at the end of June and at the same level it had shown on June 15 (see Graph 5.1).

In turn, the multilateral real exchange rate, although it is below the maximum it had reached in September 2018, continues to be positioned above the average registered between mid-2016 and March 2018 and around 50% above the level it had before the unification of the foreign exchange market in December 2015 (see Graph 5.2).
