# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information
Communication No. 40.594

## Monetary Situation (May 2001)

During May, monetary variables in general showed positive developments, reversing the behavior observed throughout the two preceding months. Although deposits show an average decline, it should be noted that this is influenced by the evolution of placements during the previous month since, during May, total deposits increased by $700 million (0.9%). For its part, placements in the private sector showed an increase of around $400 million. This growth was driven by time deposits that had been falling since the third week of February and reversed that negative trend starting from the second week of the month, showing an increase of around $900 million. It should be mentioned that the evolution of deposits described was also influenced by a tax change that implied an exemption from the tax on bank debits and credits for transactions of Mutual Investment Funds.

International reserves showed an average decline of around $1,700 million, although observing the balances at the end of the month the reduction was $190 million. This is due to the fact that, as mentioned in the communication corresponding to the month of April, the placement of a bond by the government for $2,000 million maturing in 2002 caused a decline in international reserves in mid-April. It is worth recalling that the holding of this bond is admitted as a computable item for meeting minimum liquidity requirements. On the other hand, the Central Bank had an active participation in the market conducting active repos, especially during the first half of the month, when they reached $960 million, ending May at $400 million. Financial institutions as a whole maintained their compliance with minimum liquidity requirements practically at the level of the previous month.

Interest rates, in general, during the first half of the month remained at the high levels observed throughout April, only to decline sharply starting from the third week given the liquidity existing in the market. Thus, both the interest rate for time deposits of more than one million pesos and the interest rate for short-term loans between entities were reduced by almost 7 percentage points considering the average of the second half compared to the first. Likewise, in these markets, spreads between currencies were reduced by 3 percentage points.

## Private Banks (data as of March 2001)

The total assets of private banks decreased 0.7% during March 2001. The evolution of the aforementioned item is explained fundamentally by the negative effect of holding public securities (9.8%), which for its part contracted mainly due to the decline in active repos of entities with the BCRA for the purpose of complying with minimum liquidity requirements. On the other hand, although the variation in total loans was almost nil during the period observed, its components registered diverse behaviors. The most relevant absolute changes were evidenced in the decreases in advances to the non-financial private sector and loans to the public sector, being partially offset by the increase in loans to the financial sector. If one considers net assets excluding accounting duplications generated by repo operations, forward operations and spot settlement operations, it is observed that this registered a decrease of 1.4%.

As for alternative sources of funding, negotiable obligations registered an increase of 2.1%. In turn, credit lines from abroad showed a significant increase (21.3%), explained largely by the behavior of the local branch of an important foreign entity.
# MONTHLY REPORT - CENTRAL BANK OF ARGENTINA

In March of 2001, private banks registered profits equivalent to 4.2% of net equity in annualized terms. The deterioration in profitability compared to the previous month was due, firstly, to the decline in results from holdings of financial assets and, secondly, to the increase in administrative expenses and accrued income tax. The increase in results from interest, meanwhile, attenuated the monthly reduction in profits. The closing of the first quarter of 2001 yields very encouraging results compared to the quarters of the previous year. Indeed, during the first quarter of 2001, private banks obtained profits of 7.7% of net equity in annualized terms, surpassing all quarterly records of 2000.

The total capital requirement of private banks registered a decline of 1.7% in March of 2001, explained fundamentally by the decrease in capital requirement for credit risk (1.5%), which in turn reflected the negative effect of risk-weighted assets performance. Additionally, the reduction in total capital requirement was also due to the lower requirement for market risk, which fell 19.0%. On the other hand, total capital integration showed no significant changes due to the increase in basic net equity being offset by the decrease in complementary net equity. The aforementioned changes caused an increase in integration excess, which in terms of total capital requirement went from 51.6% to 54.7%. Finally, total capital integration in terms of risk-weighted assets according to Basel rose 0.3 percentage points, placing itself at a level (20.8%) much higher than what is established by local regulation and by internationally recommended minimum requirements.
