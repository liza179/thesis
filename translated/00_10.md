## Monetary Situation (month of September)

During September there was a change in the behavior of the main monetary variables: while deposits significantly slowed their growth rate, loans to the private sector showed an increase and interest rates displayed higher levels than in the previous month.

Deposits from the private sector linked to transactions, especially savings accounts in pesos, showed a decline compared to the average of the previous month that can be partially linked to seasonal factors. On the other hand, time deposits continued to increase, although at a clearly lower rate -0.5% compared to the August average-, and led by operations arranged in dollars, which in this way represent 78.5% of total time deposits. For their part, deposits from the public sector experienced an increase of around 4.3%.

The international reserves of the financial system showed a slight decline -0.5% compared to their August average level-, as a consequence of the fall in currency circulation, since the integration of liquidity requirements increased. For its part, the backing of the Central Bank's financial liabilities with gold and foreign exchange reserves improved, going from 100.6% to 101.1%.

After a long period of stagnation, finally the figures for total loans to the private sector began to recover -0.4% compared to the August average. Growth occurred both in mortgage loans, an operation that had already been growing uninterruptedly since the previous year, as well as in lines linked to commercial activity, which had been showing declines throughout the year, presumably associated with a tax problem.

Interest rates remained at higher levels than those observed in August, despite the relative stability evidenced by country risk and international interest rates.

## Private Banks (data as of July 2000) (1)

During July, total assets of private banks registered a decline of 1.2%, basically reflecting the effect of the downward evolution of both the "Other credits from financial intermediation" item (-2.8%) and the "Loans" item (-1.1%). On the liability side, the net increase in the amount of external loan lines of the set of private banks stands out (5.6%).

During the month of July, private banks registered a gain equivalent on an annualized basis to 7.9% of net equity. The main differences with the previous month are due to the fall in administration expenses, charges for loan losses and miscellaneous results. Regarding traditional operations, results from interest increased compared to the previous month, while results from services fell, offsetting the former.

The credit portfolio quality of private banks did not experience changes, the irregular portfolio in terms of financings remained at a value of 7.9%. However, the quality of the irregular portfolio improved, thus, the uncollectible portfolio in terms of the irregular portfolio fell 0.4 percentage points. Coverage indicators did not show significant changes, in this way, the irregular portfolio net of provisions in terms of financings remained around 2.0%. For its part, credit risk, measured as the irregular portfolio net of provisions in terms of net equity, increased slightly from 9.3% to 9.8%.
The total capital requirement of private banks increased $200 million (2.8%) in the month of July 2000, explained basically by the new minimum capital requirements on holdings in investment accounts and financing to the public sector (Com."A" 3039) which reached approximately $300 million at the end of the period. The evolution of the requirement resulted in a decrease of the total excess of capital integration, given the absence of variation in the level of capital integration, passing from 56.4% to 50.3% in terms of total requirement. Due to not yet having complete information on risk-weighted assets referring to holdings in investment accounts and financing to the public sector, the table on private banks did not include the requirement for these items.

Tables are attached with the evolution of the main variables.
