## 1. Summary

• In June the BCRA completed sixteen consecutive quarters of compliance with the Monetary Program. The means of payment (M2) registered an average balance of $134,410 million, showing a decrease of close to 1 p.p. in its year-over-year growth rate compared to June 2006.

• Fixed-term deposits increased $1,110 million (1.5%), both from the private sector and the public sector. This type of placements is showing sustained growth, as a result of the BCRA's policy which led to an improvement in their returns. Likewise, it is noteworthy that the participation of fixed-term deposits from the public sector with respect to the total of their deposits equaled that presented by the private sector.

• The BCRA continued sterilizing most of the monetary expansion generated through the purchase of foreign currency in the MULC. In this month the primary placement of LEBAC and NOBAC made it possible to absorb $3,009 million. Furthermore, the only entity that maintains rediscount balances within the "matching" scheme early canceled part of its debt. As a consequence, the operations of the financial sector (not including repurchase agreements) generated a monetary contraction of $784 million. Thus, in the first half of the year, 80% of the foreign currency purchases derived from the international reserve accumulation policy implemented by the BCRA were sterilized.

• Loans to the private sector (in pesos and in foreign currency) continued to show important dynamism, increasing $2,190 million (2.7%) during June, and in the last 12 months they accumulated an increase of 36.8% in nominal terms. As in recent months, loans with real guarantees continued to accelerate their year-over-year growth rate, while consumer financing would be showing a slight deceleration.

• In mid-June the BCRA again increased the interest rates on repurchase agreements by 0.25 p.p. for all types of operations it carries out, setting from then on, the 7-day corridor at 7.5%-9.5%, while placing the interest rate for 1-day passive operations at 7.25%. The call interest rate and the BADLAR rose in line with that established as a reference by the BCRA.

• In June 2007 the underlying retail inflation measured by the CPI Rest, which is prepared by INDEC, showed an increase of 0.5% monthly, allowing that in the quarter a deceleration be verified with respect to the first three months of the year (0.6% monthly average against 1.1% of the first quarter). In turn, the variation of the CPI Rest turned out to be lower than that of June 2006 (0.6%) so that the year-over-year increase reached 9.7%, showing a reduction of 2.5 p.p. compared to the record of the same period last year.

The increase occurred both in placements from the private sector and

from the public sector. Thus, fixed-term deposits continue

showing sustained growth within the framework of a policy

of gradual increase in short-term reference interest rates

carried out by the BCRA. With respect to the public sector, it

 Repos The banking liquidity ratio, defined as cash in
 15 banks, checking accounts of banks at the BCRA and passive repos
 arranged with the BCRA, as a percentage of total deposits in pesos,
 14 was reduced to 17.5% in June, 1.2 percentage points less than the
 13 previous month. The decline in liquidity was explained by lower
 holdings of passive repos (see Chart 3.1) while the balances

 deposits The minimum cash position, although it closed with a

 somewhat different evolution during the month compared to what was

 During the first days of the month, with the cancellation of rediscounts

It should be noted that among mortgage loans, the main
volume of amounts granted occurs in loans to individuals in the
range of $100,000 to $500,000, which currently represent 45% of
loans and together with loans granted for amounts less than
$100,000 currently total 78%, compared to the 60% they represented

 During June, the main stock indices in the world –with the
 exception of BOVESPA (Brazil)- suffered losses. The month was
 characterized by a rise in interest rates, -due to fear of greater
 inflation generated by an upward revision in expectations for growth
 of the North American economy- by a global context of greater
 uncertainty, volatility and risk aversion. In particular, the US
 Treasury bond at 10 years increased throughout the month, reaching
Graphic 7.2 a maximum value of 5.3% in the period. The rise in rates along
 basis points Credit Default Swaps of Argentina with the increase in oil prices –WTI crude rose 9%- generated
 550 declines in stock markets around the world. The S&P 500 had a
 CDS 2 years CDS 5 years CDS 10 years decline of 1.8%, reaching 1,503 points while the Shanghai stock
 420
 exchange index declined 7%.

 290 In Argentina, during June the MERVAL index recorded a loss
 of 2.3%, reaching a value of 2,190 points at the end of the month.
 In the last twelve months, the MERVAL obtained a return of 28%
 160 while so far this year it amounted to only 4.8%. During June, the
 sectors with the highest returns were the electric and oil sectors,
 while those that suffered the greatest declines were the banking and
 30 steel sectors.

Public Securities

The perception of sovereign debt risk increased during June. Argentina's 5-year Credit Default Swaps (CDS) increased 47 b.p. (see Graph 7.2), while Brazil's 5-year CDS increased 13 b.p. Similarly, the spreads of emerging countries rose strongly. The spreads of external debt in Latin America measured by EMBI increased 29 b.p. during June. The spread of emerging countries in general measured by EMBI+ increased 22 b.p. Argentina was no exception, and its spread grew 48 b.p. As mentioned, an upward revision of growth estimates for the U.S. economy led to an increase in U.S. Treasury bond rates. However, greater risk aversion, resulting from the poor performance exhibited by real estate sector indicators and the complicated situation faced by some Hedge Funds operating in mortgages, caused investors to divest from emerging assets to take positions in U.S. Treasury bonds (flight to quality); a fact which together with data of inflation lower than expected, contributed to rates operating at levels lower than those recorded in the first days of the month.

The yield curve of public securities in pesos shifted upward, thereby achieving higher returns across all segments (see Graph 7.3). The yield curve of securities in dollars also achieved higher values across all segments (see Graph 7.4). The public securities that exhibited the greatest decline in their quotation were those in the long end of the yield curve, both for those denominated in dollars and for those denominated in pesos. DISC$ lost 8.8% during the month and DISCU$S fell back 7.4% in the same period.

Units linked to GDP (U.V.P.) had poor performance during the month. The U.V.P. denominated in dollars (New York law) ended the month with a value of US$14.9, reflecting a decline of 5.5% compared to May. In the same line, the U.V.P. denominated in pesos reached a value of $12.3 at month-end, declining 8.9% compared to the previous month.

The monthly increase in the investment portfolio–not including cash–was $194 million. The main variation occurred in the national public securities item, which decreased $1,150 million. Conversely, the value that AFJPs maintain in equities grew $457 million and their participation in FCIs increased $680 million. The system had an average negative return of 1.3% during June.

Assets closed the month with a value of $18,711 million, which implied a decline of 1% compared to the previous month (see Graph 7.5). The only type of fund that had significant asset growth was variable income; while money market fund assets fell significantly.

**Graph 7.7**
**Financial Trust Emissions**
[Graph showing monthly averages: 2006 avg: $630M, 2005 avg: $430M]

The assets of variable income funds increased $426 million (5%) during June. The asset increase is explained by greater subscription of fund shares. The return was negative at 2%.

Money market fund assets exhibited a negative variation of $624 million (-11.5%) compared to May. This decline responds to withdrawals by companies to cover the payment of bonuses and advance income tax payments made during the month. The average variation was negative $480 million. The return on this type of funds stood at 5% annually, 15 basis points below that recorded in the previous month (see Graph 7.6).
