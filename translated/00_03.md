# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information
Communication No. 36964

## Monetary Situation (February 2000)

The average stock of deposits in February showed an increase of 0.8% compared to the average of the previous month.
This growth was driven by term placements, especially those denominated in foreign currency, which in this way recovered the average level observed 3 months earlier. On the other hand, total loans were reduced by 0.4% during the month. Loans directed to the public sector continued with the growth rate of recent months.

International reserves of the financial system, despite the seasonal decline in monetary circulation, increased $600 million compared to the average of the previous month, accumulating an increase of 2.7% in the first two months of the year. The growth in reserves was a consequence of the significant increase in the fulfillment of minimum liquidity requirements by financial entities, an increase associated with the termination of facilities granted by this institution during the December 99-January 00 two-month period. This contributed to the fact that, despite the sustained decline in country risk, interest rates showed an increase during the month.

## Private Banks (balance data as of December 1999)

Between November and December 1999, total assets of private banks registered a decline of 6.6%. The main cause of this reduction was the sharp decrease in buy-sell operations at forward and spot rates for liquidation of financial assets, which are recorded in the "Other credits from financial intermediation" item (which for its part fell by almost 20%).

Total liquidity—that is, available funds, public securities and fulfillment of liquidity requirements (including items recorded in the "Other credits from financial intermediation" item)—was reduced by $900 million (4.4%), basically to cope with the withdrawal of deposits at the end of December.

For its part, loans to the public sector increased by just over $350 million (6.3%), while those granted to the non-financial private sector registered a decline of $600 million (1.3%). The decrease in the balance of loans to the private sector was basically due to the sharp decline in advances granted ($570 million).

Year-end seasonality and the prevailing uncertainty about the year 2000 effect caused a strong withdrawal of deposits in the last days of the year. During December, deposits fell $1,250 million (2.2%). On the other hand, a significant increase was observed in external credit lines ($750 million, that is, 12.6%).

Private banks again suffered losses in December 1999. In terms of net equity, the result for the month was –17.3% (annualized), so the year ended with a small gain of 1.9% (compared to 4.3% in 1998). However, much of the loss suffered in December is due to the fact that one financial entity, in view of its imminent absorption by a major entity, carried out a strong reclassification of the quality of its credit portfolio, imputing very high uncollectible charges. If this effect is deducted, the profitability of private banks in December is –5.1% (annualized) in terms of equity.

As is usual in December, a sharp increase in administration expenses was recorded, resulting from year-end extraordinary expenses. On the other hand, there was an increase in the result from services (also due to a seasonal effect) and in the result from assets. These increases contributed to offsetting the seasonal increase in costs.
The quality of the credit portfolio of private banks improved notably in December 1999. In particular, the irregular portfolio in terms of financing went from 7.3% to 7.1%, while the irregular portfolio net of provisions in terms of financing fell from 2.3% to 2.1%. For its part, credit risk -measured as irregular portfolio net of provisions in terms of net equity- fell 1.5 percentage points, reaching 11.8%.

The capital requirement of private banks showed no significant variations in December. For its part, capital integration recorded a slight decline, determining a decrease in the excess total integration, which went from 33.0% to 30.5% in terms of total requirement. Likewise, capital integration in terms of risk-weighted assets according to Basel verified a slight decline (0.4 percentage points), but continued to be maintained at a level (17.4%) much higher than that required by local regulation and internationally recommended.
