 Monetary Report | August 2013 | BCRA | 2 1. Summary
• In August, the broadest monetary aggregate in pesos (M3) increased 2.6%. This increase was similar to that observed in July and close to that of August 2012. Consequently, the year-over-year rate of change of M3 remained stable around 29.4%. Among the components of private M3, fixed-term placements exhibited monthly growth of 4.6% gaining participation within the aggregate, reaching in August a weight close to 31%. In this way, the year-over-year growth rate of fixed-term deposits in the private sector continued to be at historically elevated levels, reaching 42.6%. For its part, means of payment presented a slight reduction of 0.1%, mainly explained by the fall in savings account deposits, characteristic of the period following the collection of the annual mid-year bonus.

• The monthly expansion of private M3 continued to be explained by loans in pesos to the private sector, which maintained significant dynamism favored by BCRA policies aimed at promoting financing for productive activity. During the month of August, operations of the public sector and the external sector had a contractionary effect.

• Loans in pesos to the private sector presented growth of 2.7% ($10,710 million), an increase that was similar to that registered in the three previous months. In this way, they continued to show a high growth rate in year-over-year terms (38%). The increase for the month was explained both by lines more related to commercial activity, such as in the case of documents and advances, as well as by those more associated with consumption, credit card financing and personal loans.

• In August, a new auction of the Bicentennial Productive Financing Program (PFPB) was held. On this occasion, $159 million were awarded. Since the beginning of the PFPB, the total funds disbursed amounts to $5,387 million, approximately 76% of what was awarded.

• In August, the banking liquidity ratio of the peso segment (sum of cash in banks, current accounts of entities at the Central Bank, net repos with said entity and holdings of LEBAC and NOBAC as a proportion of deposits), increased 0.2 percentage points and stood at 31.7%. The asset that explained this increase was the balance of repos at the Central Bank which, in terms of deposits in pesos, grew 0.9 percentage points compared to July. In contrast, the current accounts of entities at the Central Bank in relation to deposits decreased, as a result of a change in the regulations of the Minimum Cash regime that began to take effect as of this month. With the objective of stimulating the installation of ATMs in less banked areas and promoting ATMs that can be used by the general public (and not only by the entity's clients), it was decided to include a deduction from the reserve requirement based on cash withdrawals made through ATMs that are not for the exclusive use of each entity's clients. This deduction is greater for ATMs located in more remote areas and for those located outside branches.

• The interest rates in the money market showed dissimilar movements in August. The interest rates paid by financial entities to depositors (passive) showed a slight increase. In fact, the interest rate on total new fixed-term operations in pesos averaged 15.1%, registering an increase of 0.2 percentage points compared to the July level. On the other hand, among those applied to loans in pesos to the private sector (active), those decreased compared to the July averages: the interest rate on advances in current accounts to companies (for more than $10 million and up to 7 days maturity) and that corresponding to mortgage loans to individuals. For its part, the average

monthly of the interest rate of the documents at under the signature remained with respect to the previous month, while those corresponding to the interest rates of pawn loans and those granted through document discounting increased slightly.

**Note:** This excerpt appears to be a fragment from a larger document. The phrase "a so la firma" seems to be a parsing error from the PDF and may have originally been "a la firma" (at/by signature) or a similar term. The context suggests this is discussing interest rate movements in different types of credit instruments (signed documents, pawn loans, and discounted documents).

Regarding deposits in foreign currency, the average monthly balance decreased, with reductions in both placements belonging to the private sector and those corresponding to the public sector.

Finally, the broadest monetary aggregate, M3*, which includes the total of deposits in pesos and in foreign currency (expressed in pesos), presented a growth of 2.4%, accumulating a year-on-year variation of 27.8%.

**Graph 3.1 - Bank Liquidity in Pesos**

## 3. Bank Liquidity¹

In August, the banking liquidity ratio of the peso segment (sum of cash in banks, current accounts of entities in the Central Bank, net repos with said entity and holdings of LEBACs and NOBACs as a proportion of deposits) increased 0.2 p.p. and was located at 31.7% (see Graph 3.1). The asset that explained this increase was the balance of repos in the Central Bank which, in terms of deposits in pesos, increased 0.9 p.p. compared to July.

On the other hand, the current accounts of entities in the Central Bank in relation to deposits decreased, as a result of a change in the regulations of the Minimum Cash regime that began to apply as of this month. With the objective of stimulating the installation of ATMs in less banked areas and promoting ATMs that can be used by the general public (and not only by customers of the entity), through Communication "A" 5471 it was provided to include a deduction from the encaje requirement based on cash withdrawals made through automatic teller machines that are not for the exclusive use of each entity's customers.

Thus, this deduction is differentiated based on two criteria related to ATM location: (1) whether it is inside or outside a branch and (2) the jurisdiction in which it is located. The deduction is greater for ATMs located outside branches and for those located in areas with a lower degree of development and banking penetration. As a consequence of this measure, in August a reduction in the requirement equivalent to 0.4% of total deposits in pesos was verified (see Graph 3.2), while the position of the minimum cash regime (integration minus requirement) resulting was in line with that of previous months (0.2% of deposits).

For its part, in August the liquidity ratio of the foreign currency segment, on average, was equivalent to 111.3% of deposits in dollars, 4.1 p.p. above that of July.

## 4. Loans¹⁴⁵

**Loans in Pesos to the Private Sector**

Loans in pesos to the private sector presented in August a growth of 2.7% ($10,710 million), an increase that was similar to that observed during the previous three months (see Graph 4.1). In this way, credit continued to show a high growth rate in year-on-year terms (38%). This behavior was explained both by the lines more related to commercial activity, such as the case of
documents and advances, as well as those more associated with consumption, credit card financings and personal loans (see Chart 4.2).

Source: BCRA

Within the lines essentially oriented toward companies, advances showed an increase of 3.4% ($1,880 million), registering one of the largest increases of recent years for the month (see Chart 4.3). The year-on-year variation rate stood at 27.6%, slightly below that observed in July. For its part, financings implemented through documents showed growth of 2.5% ($2,280 million), accumulating in the last twelve months a variation of 57.1%. Finally, the remaining commercial financings, grouped under the "Other loans" heading, registered a reduction of 0.8% ($260 million) in the period.

Continuing with the policy to stimulate productive credit, in August a new auction was conducted within the framework of the Bicentennial Productive Financing Program (PFPB). On this occasion $170 million were auctioned, of which $159 million were awarded ($150 million to the National Bank of Argentina and $9 million to the Investment and Foreign Trade Bank). Thus, since the beginning of the PFPB, the total funds disbursed amounts to $5,387 million, around 76% of that awarded. When distinguishing these resources according to the economic sector to which they were destined, manufacturing industry stands out, concentrating around 70% of the total loans.

In turn, when discriminating the total loans in local currency to the productive sector according to the debtor's main economic activity, it is also observed that, since mid-2012, there is an increasing participation of financing to manufacturing industry.

As for the lines oriented toward financing consumption by families, a slight increase is observed in the pace of granting personal loans, after a smaller increase in July due to seasonal factors associated with the collection of the annual supplementary half-month bonus. Thus, in August, personal loans registered an increase of 2.5% ($2,200 million), while the year-on-year variation rate stood at 30.9%.

For its part, credit card financings grew 5.2% ($3,340 million), accelerating their monthly expansion rate, showing the highest growth of 2013 and the highest for August in recent years. Thus, its year-on-year variation rate increased 2.3 percentage points.

However, the monetary policy rate could be altered if: 1) the projections of the English Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) for inflation over the following 18-24 months exceed by 0.5 p.p. or more the inflation target (2%) or; 2) inflation expectations do not remain sufficiently "anchored" or, 3) risks occur that affect financial stability

and that could not be resolved with the available macroprudential instruments.

The BoE stated that the conditionality between the Bank Rate and the unemployment rate seeks to: 1) prevent a premature increase in market interest rates as economic recovery consolidates and, 2) provide greater certainty regarding the MPC's view of the trade-off between the horizon in which inflation will take to reach the target and the speed at which growth and unemployment rate are recovering. In this sense, according to the latest BoE projections, unemployment would not fall below 7% before the third quarter of 2016, for which only at the end of that year would the conditions be in place that could lead to an increase in the monetary policy interest rate.

This BoE decision to resort to policies based on forward guidance¹¹ follows the same line as that of the European Central Bank (ECB) which in early July, for the first time in its history, decided to provide a perspective regarding the future evolution of its policy, by stating that it expects its monetary policy rate (MRO) to remain at current levels for an extended period.

The BoE's decision is framed in a context where monetary policy, both in developed and emerging countries, had to react to the effects that, beginning in early May, produced in the markets the speculations about the reduction in the rate of asset purchases by the U.S. Federal Reserve (see Graphs 7.2 and 7.3).

In the case of emerging countries, the main transmission channel of the change in expectations were capital flows; this led to that, although with different magnitude, almost all currencies of emerging countries lost value with respect to the U.S. dollar.

In this sense, Argentina's main commercial partner, Brazil, had a depreciation of its currency of 4.8% in the month, and 16.3% so far this year. This led the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) to announce that it will offer daily, starting August 23 and at least until December 31, 2013, currency swap operations of US$500 million Monday through Thursday, and every Friday active peso operations in dollars for up to US$1,000 million. The BCB had already intervened on different days in the foreign exchange market before this announcement. Throughout the month, operations in said market were through currency swaps, for approximately the equivalent of US$19,000 million (without impact on reserves

8% and in the IGPA (Chile) it registered a fall of 1.8%. In
the case of Brazil, the fall was entirely explained by the
depreciation of the real against the dollar, since the index
measured in local currency grew 3.7%. Meanwhile, in
Mexico the decrease was driven by both the fall in the
index in local currency and the depreciation of the
Mexican peso against the dollar. For its part, in Chile the
fall recorded in the index in local currency was partly
offset by the strengthening of the Chilean peso against
the dollar.

In contrast to the rest of the emerging stock markets, the
local reference index (Merval) measured in dollars again
registered good performance and closed August with a
gain of 17.2% monthly. Although the increases were
widespread, the increase in the quotation of bank
securities stood out. The average daily volume traded in
shares during August was $82 million, which marked a
monthly increase of 71%.

total (see Chart 8.5).

The financial sector comprised 73% of the total placed.
Financial entities were the main issuers with an amount
of $1,177 million. In second place were companies in the
"Other Financial, Stock Market and Insurance Activities"
sector, which took on debt for almost $240 million.

 In August, the issuances of financial trusts
 (FF) totaled around $1,870 million,
 registering a decline compared to the record amount of
 July (see Chart 8.9). Nevertheless, it was positioned above
 what was issued on average throughout the year, around
 $1,500 million monthly. Likewise, 20
 placements were registered (one of them in foreign currency), which
 represented a slight decrease compared to the 22
 operations registered in July.

13 Only trusts with public offering are considered.

 Monetary Report | August 2013 | BCRA | 16

Among the settlors, financial entities stood out again,
being responsible for half of the total issued in the month. They
placed around $910 million, surpassing the significant volume of
placements in July and thus reaching the largest amount
so far this year. The assets securitized by financial
entities were composed mainly of personal loans, but also
securitizations of leasing contracts and credit card
coupons were registered. In order of importance, retail
businesses followed, which issued around $590 million (31% of the total), somewhat less than
the previous month. The placements were backed
by personal loans and credit card coupons. For their part, mutual
societies, cooperatives, non-banking credit card
issuers and other financial service providers issued
around $340 million. Among the assets securitized by
this type of settlors were personal loans linked to
consumption and collateral loans. The remainder corresponded to an issuance, denominated in
foreign currency, from a group of SMEs
belonging to the agricultural sector.

The cut-off interest rate (amount-weighted average) of senior
titles in pesos with duration of less than 14 months and
agreed at variable rate registered an increase of 0.9 p.p. and
was positioned at 18.4%. In the fixed rate segment, only one
placement was registered, whose cut-off rate was 18.7% (see Chart 8.10).
