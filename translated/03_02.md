Monthly Monetary Report
February 2003

## Summary

ü During February, the broad monetary base expanded $672 million (1.8%), which compares with 0.9% in the previous month. Even so, the figures remain well below the 6.8% monthly average increase of the last quarter of 2002. The main factor of expansion was the liquidation of exports. Nevertheless, this factor has exhibited a decreasing weight since January, given the regulations that reduced BCRA intervention in said operations.

ü BCRA reserves increased USD 963 million (10.3%). Thus, the resources used in interventions in the foreign exchange market initiated last year have already been more than recovered: the accumulated reserve flows from these operations since February 2002 amount to more than USD 300 million.

ü Private means of payment (M2) ended February with a very slight decline with respect to the previous month (-0.2%). Although a reduction in sight deposits of approximately $450 million (2.2%) was observed, consistent with the lower transactional needs typical of the month, currency in the hands of the public increased by slightly more than $400 million (2.8%) - a behavior that does not align with the seasonal pattern.

ü Private sector fixed-term placements continued to exhibit considerable growth, increasing over the course of February by approximately $2,500 million (12%); the net increase derived from the early repayment of rescheduled deposits (CEDRO) was approximately $1,800 million (9%). A significant growth in terms shorter than one month was observed. This cannot be disconnected from the political scenario prior to the national elections.

ü Interest rates rebounded with respect to January: for 30-day placements, they went from 18% to 21.5% (TNA). Both the early repayment of CEDRO and the market's expectation about the BCRA's sterilization needs (later clarified by the monetary authority itself) pressured interest rates upward; nor can the influence of uncertainty about the national elections be ruled out.

ü February inflation was 0.6%, less than half that of January – an evolution expected for seasonal reasons. Goods showed a price increase of 0.8%, and services a variation of 0.1%. The variation in retail prices is thus more in line with that observed in the last months of last year.

ü The monetary targets agreed with the IMF corresponding to January were exceeded broadly, while the February targets are also being met in excess (the measurement period for these covers up to 2/14). Although the targets have been set with bimonthly frequency, the Central Bank evaluates its performance against them with monthly periodicity, seeking to establish a more demanding framework for the execution and control of monetary policy.

ü Net issuance of LEBAC was considerably lower than that of the previous month. The average nominal cost paid for issuances in pesos and dollars remained stable. However, lower quantities of longer-term instruments were demanded. Inflation-adjusted letters were successfully reintroduced, validating an implicit inflation rate for the current year not exceeding 22%.

ü Credit to the private sector continued to decline, although it did so at a slightly lower rate than observed during January: net cancellations amounted to $741 million (a decline of 2.4% of the loan stock, compared to 2.7% in January).

1 Monthly Monetary Report—February 2003

Evolution of the broad monetary base and international reserves
As observed in Table I, during February the broad monetary base expanded by $672 million (1.8%), which compares to 0.9% in the previous month. Still, the figures remain well below the 6.8% monthly average increase from the last quarter of 2002. This was due to increases in both currency in circulation ($303 million) and bank reserves ($369 million). The main factor of monetary base expansion was the liquidation of exports – this implied an increase in monetization of approximately $900 million. However, this factor has shown a markedly decreasing weight since January, given the regulations that reduced BCRA intervention in such operations. As in previous months, these measures were in line with the intention to provide greater flexibility to the foreign exchange market (which is detailed further on in this report). Government operations had a very reduced effect, leading to an expansion of $57 million. Within such operations, it should be mentioned that the inflow of funds from international organizations was partially offset by the cancellation of temporary advances. Operations between the monetary authority and the financial sector had a relatively moderate effect, implying a contraction of $180 million (basically consistent with the cancellation of rediscounts and the payment of interest on them by entities). Finally, the issuance of LEBAC generated a decrease in base of $117 million.

BCRA reserves increased in February by USD 963 million (10.3%), which was basically due to an increase in the Government account of USD 600 million (associated with funds that entered from international organizations). The remainder of the increase is mainly due to operations with the private sector. Central Bank reserves thus amount to USD 10,288 million. It is important to note that the reserves used in foreign exchange market interventions initiated last year have already been more than recovered: the reserve flows accumulated from these operations since February 2002 amount to more than USD 300 million. That is, all resources that were allocated to intervening in the foreign exchange market during 2002 have not only been recovered, but reserves have begun to accumulate through interventions, as observed in Graph 1.

 Monthly Purchase-Sale Accumulated

Regarding the future evolution of the broad monetary base, the announcement of plans to redeem provincial quasi-currencies should be highlighted. In effect, during the month of February the official intention was announced to redeem provincial bonds with maturity in 2003: they include emissions of Cecacor (Corrientes), Federal (Entre Ríos), Quebracho (Chaco), Bocanfor (Formosa) and Bocade, series A (La Rioja). The total amount, at nominal value, of the aforementioned securities amounts to $555 million.
From the announcement, a rise was noted in the quotations of several of these securities —a rise that had begun earlier in some cases, since already in October 2002 there began to be talk of official rescue plans (see Chart 2). On one hand, the rise could be due to the fact that, faced with news of a rescue, it is considered that the probability of repayment increases —even if at market value— of the security: if there were doubts about the solvency of the issuing state, the announcement of a rescue by the National State can generate a "premium for rescue expectations" on the original market price¹. On the other hand, the higher quotation could be due to the expectation of a rescue that recognizes some price higher than the market price.

¹ In turn, the original price can be decomposed into a "market value" (which basically reflects the solvency of the issuing state) and a "liquidity premium" (which captures the degree to which the bond can be used as circulating medium).

Monetary Aggregates: slight decline in money supply and growth in time deposits

Private money supply (M2)² ended February with a very slight decline compared to the previous month —decreased approximately $80 million between late February and late January (0.2%). In real terms, M2 decreased 0.8% (taking the nominal M2 balances and deflating them by the Consumer Price Index), as observed in Chart 3. Typically, the needs for greater transactions linked to the summer season are reduced as summer progresses. In this way, a reduction in demand deposits of about $500 million was observed compared to the previous month. However, currency in the hands of the public increased by somewhat more than $400 million (2.8%); in real terms, the variation was 2.1%. The behavior of currency does not generally result in line with the seasonal pattern typical of the month: although it registered some uptick until mid-February, since then it has not shown the expected decline. Among the reasons that could explain the lack of decrease in the quantity demanded of bills and coins in the second half of February could be pointed out the early return of rescheduled deposits (CEDRO), expanded during that period. It is estimated that, of the CEDRO released in February, about $300 million were withdrawn and did not remain in the banks in the form of deposits.

The evolution of monetary aggregates (see Table 2, following page) occurred in the context of the progressive lifting of financial restrictions known as the "corralón". During February, the possibility of early return by financial institutions was expanded. Up to the time of producing this report, early return offers represent 26% of CEDRO and the proportion of these held by entities making such offers amounts to 90% of the total of these instruments. Available data indicates that acceptance of offers by savers amounts to 24% of placements whose return has been offered (6% of CEDRO). Within such acceptances, cash withdrawals represent only 1% of the total CEDRO (the early return of deposits is detailed in a note starting on page 14 of this report).
Fixed-term placements in the private sector continued to exhibit considerable growth: throughout February, they increased by approximately $2,500 million (12%) in the private sector. This growth was partly associated with the early repayment of CEDRO. The increase in fixed-term placements - net of the increase derived from early repayment - was approximately $1,800 million (9%). The term that increased the most in absolute terms was that of 30 to 59 days, as has been occurring in recent months; however, significant growth was also observed in terms of less than one month (in fact, placements with those maturities were those with the highest relative growth), in contrast

with the three previous months. Thus, a decline was observed in the average maturity of these deposits, although only significant toward the end of the month (maturity went from 42.5 days on January 31 to 41.5 days at the end of February).

The behavior of sight deposits and fixed-term placements mentioned above determined that deposits in pesos of the private sector increased during February by approximately $2,000 million (an increase of 4.5%). If the effect that injunctions and disaffiliations of CEDRO (for all purposes) had on such growth is netted out, the increase in deposits of the private sector was $750 million (1%) compared to the previous month.

It cannot be overlooked, as one of the determinants of savers' behavior during the month in question, the expectation regarding a court ruling on "re-dollarization". At the end of February, the probability that such a ruling would be issued was high: this would potentially affect the current CEDRO balance, U$S 8,800 million. For this reason, it is of interest to "reconstruct" the evolution of the rescheduling until the current balance is reached, which is shown in Table 3. From an initial balance of U$S 46,400 million on December 31, 2001, a first disaffiliation was made through voluntary pesification; the remaining balance (64% of the initial) was rescheduled. The rescheduled deposits still suffered balance decreases through: injunction actions; a first exchange for Government Bonds (Boden 2012, 2007 and 2005; those who did not opt for them, proceeded to maintain CEDRO balances); a second exchange (Boden 2013) and the de-rescheduling of deposits up to $10,000; the use of rescheduled deposits for various purposes, including loan cancellation, purchase of real estate, cars, etc. All the aforementioned set of disaffiliations represented 46% of the initial balance.

Interest Rates and Inflation
Interest rates registered, on average, a slight increase with respect to the previous month: those corresponding to 30-day deposits went from 18% to 19.5% (monthly averages). The evolution throughout the month, however, was somewhat more marked than what the average figures show: if the fixed-term interest rate for 30 days had started February at 18%, it ended the month at 21.5%. With the lower inflation registered in February, this also implied a slight increase in real interest rates (nominal rates deflated by the Consumer Price Index) from the very low levels of January, as observed in Graph 4.

Nominal Real

The interest rate for interbank loans (call) in pesos, for its part, rose from 5.7% to 6.4% (on average); the volume traded between private financial entities went from $105 million in January to $175 million in February, thus recovering the level it showed in October of last year.

The uptick in interest rates was observed especially from the second half of February. At least two factors contributed to it: the early repayment of CEDRO and the market's expectation regarding the BCRA's sterilization needs. Several of the entities that offered such repayment increased their interest rates in order, on one hand, to encourage their customers to maintain or increase their deposits and, on the other hand, to capture funds to repay—this also would have led other entities that were not repaying deposits early to raise their rates, so as not to lose market share. On the other hand, based on information about monetary and fiscal targets, the market interpreted that "excessive" sterilization needs were presenting themselves to the BCRA, which would lead it to raise the LEBAC cutoff rates in March in order to absorb the necessary amount. When the information about exceeding the targets was correctly incorporated (information that included the announcement, by the monetary authority, that sterilization needs were lower than expected), the pressure on rates began to ease. Finally, it cannot be ruled out that uncertainty about the national elections contributed to pushing interest rates upward, and that this be a factor that weighs increasingly in the coming weeks. The evolution of interest rates for terms greater than 60 days is consistent with the observations in the previous paragraph: in private banks, they went from 21% at the end of January to 23% at the end of February, showing peaks of up to 31% during the month.

If data from large investors are taken (fixed-term deposits of more than $1 million in private banks), the rates for terms of between 25 and 35 days (those with the highest volume traded) went from 16% in January to 22% in February (on average). Such rates, likewise, were those that showed the largest average increase in February (see Graph 5). This latter data is consistent with the uncertainty about the political scenario mentioned in the previous paragraph.

February inflation (measured through the Consumer Price Index, CPI–GBA) was 0.6%, well below the 1.3% in January – an evolution to be expected for seasonal reasons. The variation in retail prices compared to the same month of the previous year was 36.1%. Goods – which represent 53% of the basket on which the index is calculated – showed a price increase of 0.8%, and services a variation of 0.1%. The item with the greatest impact was food and beverages; within services, the greatest impact was recorded by the medical care and health item. The variation in consumer prices is thus more in line with that observed in the last months of the previous year.

**Credit: decrease lower than that observed in January**

Private sector credits continued declining in February, although they did so at a slightly lower rate than in January: net cancellations amounted to somewhat more than $700 million (a decline of 2.4%, against 2.7% in January). Available information indicates that the decline in credits is basically related to the maturity of the existing stock, given the lack of granting of new loans.

The behavior of the two major loan categories was not similar, even though both showed declines: while consumer loans decreased to a greater extent than during the previous month, commercial credits decreased at a lower rate. The evolution of the latter is consistent with the seasonal pattern: as the summer recess ends, commercial and industrial activity picks up, and this is reflected in credit.

Commercial loans were reduced by about $300 million (2%) compared to the previous month, a decline smaller than that in January (3.6%). Apart from entities with very little participation in the volume of credits (credit unions and financial companies), the banks that concentrated the decline were those with predominantly foreign capital and public banks. In contrast, private national banks showed a very slight decline, and branches of foreign banks exhibited a modest increase in this type of credit (see Chart 6). The commercial loan portfolio of these entities represents 45% of the total in this category.

Consumer credits decreased by $455 million compared to the previous month (-2.6%, against –1.8% in January). Among the groups of entities with significant weight in the market, banks with predominantly foreign capital and public banks were also those that recorded the largest declines in this category. Branches of foreign banks and banks with national capital were those that showed smaller declines in the loan stock (particularly the latter). Within the consumer segment, the behavior of mortgages stands out, which showed a much smaller decline than in the three previous months; unlike these, personal loans showed a more pronounced decline, and credit card financing decreased after increasing in December and January (a movement that can in principle be attributed to seasonal factors, taking into account that the year-end holidays have already passed and the summer season is coming to an end).

If the lower rate of decrease in loans to the private sector cannot, in principle, be attributed to anything more than a seasonal phenomenon, it can at least be interpreted in terms that the conditions of the credit market have not worsened significantly. Only to the extent that the incipient reactivation marked by some indicators (such as industrial activity indicators) consolidates itself and that "perturbation factors" are not introduced on the system's liquidity, will it be possible to begin to hint at an improvement in credit conditions.

8 Monthly Monetary Report—February 2003

Monetary targets: over-fulfillment and transparency in monitoring

A salient feature of the monetary front during February was the over-fulfillment of the monetary targets agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund: as of February 14, the over-fulfillment of January's objectives was confirmed³, already anticipated in our previous report; and the information available at the close of this report showed that February's targets are also being exceeded. Note that, although targets have been set with bimonthly frequency, the Central Bank evaluates its performance against them with monthly periodicity (target monitoring can be carried out through the BCRA website). In this way, the BCRA seeks to set an even more demanding framework than that established with international organizations for the execution and control of monetary policy, consistent with its objective of preserving the value of the currency.

The Net International Reserves (RIN, international reserves minus Central Bank liabilities with the IMF) target for February is being over-fulfilled by almost USD 1,300 million⁴. In turn, the Net Domestic Assets target (AIN, broad monetary base minus RIN, valued at an exchange rate of 3.85$/USD) is being exceeded by more than $ 5,000 million. The over-fulfillment of this target is relevant in that it shows that currently the broad monetary base not "backed" by reserves is well below the "critical" limit set in the agreement with the IMF. Finally, the indicative target for broad Monetary Base is also over-fulfilled in February, by almost $ 400 million (unlike the other objectives, this target is not binding). Table 3 shows the fulfillment of targets in January (final data) and in February (provisional data).

* Deviation: In AIN and Monetary Base the negative sign (-) indicates over-fulfillment.
In RIN the positive sign (+) indicates over-fulfillment.

LEBAC: lower issuance and stability of average cost

Given the under-fulfillment of the targets set with the IMF and the consequent lower need for sterilization, the net issuance of LEBAC was considerably lower than that of the previous month. It represented a monetary contraction of $117 million in February. The average nominal cost paid for issuances in pesos and dollars remained stable, standing at 33.3% for LEBAC in pesos. However, a lower quantity of longer-term instruments was demanded. From the end of January, demand concentrated on instruments with average life of up to six months, which resulted in the reduction of the average life of the amount of LEBAC in circulation in pesos, which went from 139 to 126 days at the end of the month under analysis (in Graph 7 the amounts offered can be observed, broken down by

 LEBAC in pesos adjusted by CER reappeared in the market, now with 6 and 12 months average life. These securities proved attractive, with VN $63 million having been awarded in the last days of the month (they were auctioned for the first time on February 25th). It is worth noting that the implicit inflation validated is less than 22%. The total stock of LEBAC in pesos as of February 28th was $4,222 million in nominal value, while the amount in circulation of letters issued in dollars reached VN US$204 million. Taking into account the auctions held until the end of February, during March $753 million and US$204 million mature, distributed according to the configuration detailed in Graph 8.

 If one observes the cut rates of LEBAC in pesos and compares them with those implicit in the quotation of the future dollar (as agreed in NDF contracts, Non-Deliverable Forward) in New York, one notes a progressive decrease in the spread existing between the two – see Graph 9, where the comparison is made for the 1 and 6 month terms. It is verified that the yield of LEBAC aligns with international market conditions, thus reasonably reflecting the expectations of economic agents.

 Finally, it is relevant to observe the holdings of LEBAC by legal entities (companies, institutional investors, etc.): Their evolution in recent months shows the growing interest of the same in this instrument (which is shown in Graph 10). Note also the growing participation of AFJP (the most important institutional investor) in holdings by legal entities, representing 40% of the same. Progress is thus being made toward the dual objective of establishing LEBAC as an attractive investment alternative in the local market and of having them provide a valid reference rate.

**Foreign Exchange Market: Progress continues toward normal functioning**

This month also saw the expansion of measures aimed at the normal functioning of the foreign exchange market. Thus, to the provisions taken in December and January were added the following ones.

• The exceptions to authorization requirements for transfers abroad by the private sector were expanded for cancellations of new financing entered through the Single Free Foreign Exchange Market as of February 11, 2002 and for payment of debts with multilateral credit organizations with clauses that imply treatment no less favorable than the most favored multilateral financial organization creditor (Com. "A" 3878). It is estimated that this measure positively affected demand by USD 34 million.

• The possibility of making payments of capital services and interest was expanded provided that the monthly amount paid does not exceed USD 300,000 monthly (thus doubling the previous limit) or that debts as of December 31, 2001 were not higher than USD 1,000,000 and that capital services were due as of December 31, 2002 (Com. "A" 3880). Payments for these items would have reached USD 11 million.

• The limit for purchase of foreign currency to establish fiduciary funds for financial debt restructuring was increased (from 3% to 5% of expired and unpaid debt) for original maturities through December 31, 2002 (Com. "A" 3880). The effect of this measure is estimated at USD 26 million.

• The maximum limit of the General Foreign Exchange Position of financial entities was set at 10% of Computable Equity Responsibility (such limit had been raised from 5% to 6%, and then to 8%, in January) registered at the end of November 2001 (Com. "A" 3880). It is estimated that entities increased their position by approximately USD 5 million.

As in previous months, the measures are in line with the intention to provide flexibility to the foreign exchange market, and for it to fully reflect the free interaction of economic agents. It is worth noting that the greater opening was not accompanied in February by greater volatility. On the contrary, the volatility of the peso/dollar exchange rate decreased appreciably with respect to the previous month (as observed in Graph 9). These measures represent relatively marginal changes to those already put into effect the previous month – during January the combined effect of the adopted measures amounted to approximately USD 350 million, while in February it was on the order of USD 190 million.

Although during the month the local currency appreciated against the dollar, it ended the period slightly below the quotation at the end of January: it depreciated 0.6% (taking the reference exchange rate prepared by the BCRA; see Graph 11). In contrast, the peso appreciated against the Brazilian currency by 1.9% during the second month of the year, and closed practically unchanged against the euro (+0.1%, although until mid-month it had registered some appreciation).

**Stock Market**

The local stock market ended the month of February with a rise of 8% in pesos and 7% in dollars, accumulating an annual return in dollars of 19%. The average daily volume traded was around $35 million, a level similar to that of January. The positive result was influenced by the

12 Monthly Monetary Report—February 2003
Telecom announcement of the repurchase of part of its financial debt, which resulted in a 22% increase in the stock price. The announcement by the telephone company had a positive impact on other public service providers with similar debt structures.

As occurred in previous months, the performance of this market was disconnected from international developments, where declines were widespread (as can be seen in Chart 12) and were again influenced by instability surrounding geopolitical issues and their possible impact on growth and corporate profits of companies operating in those markets. For its part, the Brazilian stock exchange showed a sharp decline, partially linked to the increase in banking reserve requirements from 45 to 60% for demand deposits; this negatively impacted profit margin expectations and bank valuations. Likewise, the possibility of triggering a war involving the United States unfavorably affected the valuation of Brazilian Aeronautics Company (Embratel), as this could result in harm to its financial situation. The external context also had an impact on the performance of Petrobras shares, a company that has not implemented price increases since December 29 despite the subsequent international increase in oil prices.

Note: Early Return of CEDRO (February 2003)

Introduction

Starting from the last week of January 2003, some financial entities began offering early return options for reprogrammed deposit certificates (CEDRO). Subsequently, entering the month of February, new entities of various relative sizes implemented similar policies. The BCRA regulations on this matter initially required that banks receiving financial assistance for liquidity provided by said institution should cancel rediscounts for an amount equivalent to the maximum estimated disbursement of the agreed improvements. Additionally, the need was established to individually evaluate entities to analyze whether their liquidity situation would allow them to meet estimated payments without needing to resort to BCRA assistance. Finally, the conditions for banks with obligations to the BCRA were flexibilized, ruling that the amount to be returned from these financings be equivalent to what was actually released by the improvements made.

Characterization

At the beginning of the early release of CEDRO, the amount to be paid—capital plus CER as of January 2003—by the financial system amounted to approximately $18,700 million. As can be seen in Chart 12, in terms of the original maturity profile, half of the liquidity needs derived from CEDRO payments were concentrated in 2004, while for the remainder of the current year these amounted to 27% of the total amount, leaving 23% to be paid in 2005.

During February, a group of entities whose holding of CEDRO represented approximately 90% of the total system decided to opt for carrying out redemption offers of the same. The placements made available to their clients involved an amount equivalent to 30% of their total CEDRO and 26% of the CEDRO balance of the system. Within this group of banks, those that began the return at the beginning of the month and those that announced their proposals at the end of the month are distinguished. The first group was characterized by offering their clients the total of the CEDRO originally in pesos and, depending on the case, all of those established in dollars or up to a limit of $42,000. The second group comprised institutions of great systemic importance and was distinguished by making offers limited to the CEDRO series for deposits originally denominated in local currency. As a consequence of the low proportion released and the size of the entities in this last group, the total proportion of CEDRO made available decreased significantly.

14 Monthly Monetary Report—February 2003

Another important characteristic that identifies the second group is that in its entirety these are banks with Central Bank of Argentina assistance, while the entities that began at the beginning of February in few cases observed this type of funding. The foregoing is consistent with the restrictions imposed by the Central Bank of Argentina regarding early repayment of CEDRO for entities with the aforementioned obligations.

According to information provided by the entities, it was initially estimated that depositors who would opt for voluntary deprogramming would reach 38% ($1,900 million) of the total amount of CEDRO offered: savers whose original deposits were in pesos would obtain the remainder in pesos of the original capital and accrued and uncollected interest; those who had agreed to placements in dollars would obtain the remainder in pesos for an amount equivalent to $1.4/USD plus CER and interest. These estimates prepared by the banks, which a priori looked conservative, arose from considering that a significant proportion of depositors would have pending injunction resources or would be awaiting a ruling by the Supreme Court of Justice regarding the general redollarization of placements.

On the other hand, financial entities expected that 54%, approximately $1,000 million, of the deposits that would be divested would remain deposited in the same bank. In turn, the hypothesis was considered that customers who decided to keep their money in the system would show a segmentation equivalent to 70% and 30% in term placements and on-demand placements respectively.

Based on expected behaviors and existing regulations, the cash requirements that would be involved in the early repayment of CEDRO would amount to a figure close to $1,300 million, reflecting the effect of cash withdrawal from reprogrammed deposits ($900 million), the increase in the requirement for minimum cash ($300 million) and the cancellation of debts with the Central Bank of Argentina relevant ($100 million). These cash requirements would constitute 14% of the liquidity of this group of banks—integration in current account at the Central Bank of Argentina and cash in banks in pesos—, considered on the day prior to the beginning of each entity's offer.

Results of February 2003

During February 2003, depositors voluntarily opted to deprogramm an amount close to $1,200 million (24%), a figure much lower than the estimates made by the entities in their
# 15 Monthly Monetary Report—February 2003

as a whole. It is possible that the effect derived from the expectation of recovery of placements in original currency -through legal remedies or redollarization- may have been greater than that considered by the banks. For their part, the proportion of unencumbered deposits that returned to the entities turned out to be greater than estimated, reaching 77% of them, of which 71% reinvested in time deposits and the rest in demand deposits -savings accounts and current accounts-.

Therefore, the cash requirement generated by the early redemption resulted in a figure much lower than estimated, barely exceeding $600 million and representing 7% of initial liquidity.

Next, it is considered appropriate to make a brief mention regarding the evolution since 2002 of placements subject to restrictions regarding their availability. As can be observed in Graph 14, as of May 2002, with the validity of the so-called "corralito" -restrictions on demand account deposits- and the "corralón" -initially rescheduled deposits and later CEDRO- 86% of system deposits did not have free mobility. With successive reschedulings, the "trickle" -withdrawal of deposits according to the restrictions of demand placements- of the Corralito and the slow return of investment in the financial system -consequence of the high interest rates paid by the entities- this proportion gradually decreased until reaching 75% in November of last year, just before the opening of the Corralito. Once the amount of deposits in the latter was released, the ratio between unavailable and total deposits fell to 30% at the end of January 2003. According to what has been observed so far, that ratio would remain in the order of 28% at the end of March 2003, equally a figure much lower than that recorded at the beginning of 2002.

**Effects**

While a release of Corralón deposits has various effects on monetary and financial variables, in this section the analysis focuses on the repercussions on the amounts operated and the interest rates of deposits in the non-financial private sector.

The cancellations of CEDRO had direct consequences on the evolution of the amount of "new" deposits. As mentioned previously, customers representing approximately three-quarters of the CEDRO who chose to accept the offer decided that the best investment alternative for their money continued to be the same bank, increasing the balance of deposits by approximately $900 million.

# 16 Monthly Monetary Report—February 2003
As can be seen in Graph 15, in the case of entities that announced the early return of CEDRO, the increase in fixed-term deposits was 23% in February. It is estimated that almost half of that increase is explained by the release of rescheduled funds and subsequent reinvestment at a fixed term in the same entity. In turn, the rest of the financial institutions also registered growth in their fixed-term deposits. From this latter group, entities with BCRA assistance captured fixed-term placements of 8% of the stock from the end of January. Consequently, a second-order effect is observed here reflected –ceteris paribus- in the greater net capture of fixed-term deposits by the banks that advanced the availability of their CEDRO compared to those that did not. This differential –not considering reinvestment from CEDRO redemption- is estimated at approximately 4% marginal gain in fixed-term placements and would be consistent with a certain effect caused by the improvement in the reputation of the entities that anticipated the return.

On the other hand, a rise in interest rates was to be expected during the course of CEDRO redemption, as evidenced by Graph 16. The convenience of entities in retaining customers combined with preliminary uncertainty factors justified the aforementioned hypothesis.

Indeed, from the beginning of the partial opening of the Corralón, a gradual increase in interest rates on fixed-term deposits was evident. It should be noted that the evolution of the aforementioned variable was not related to the variation of reference rates —in this case LEBACs in pesos at one month were considered— since they showed a slightly downward trend in the observed month. On one hand, the entities that joined the offer, on average, made a partial effort to retain depositors by increasing fixed-term rates by 2.9 percentage points –weighted average by amount operated– in the observed period. It should be clarified that the aforementioned behavior was relatively homogeneous within the same group, although some entities that reduced their interest rates were observed. This conduct resulted, via an increase in deposits, in an important reduction in the liquidity needs of the banks involved and, consequently, contributed notably —especially in some entities— to the fulfillment of minimum cash requirements.

For entities that did not make the offers and with restrictions on CEDRO redemption due to maintaining obligations with the BCRA, the situation was different. Within the framework of an image gain by entities that paid their CEDRO and the need to participate soon in the early offerings, this group of banks had to increase the fixed-term interest rate even further, growing 3.7 percentage points between extremes.
Although said increase in interest rates was detected in all sizes of time deposits, in this case, they respond mainly to the movement of the largest deposits. It is worth noting that in the case of fixed-term deposits for small amounts, unlike the rest, the increase, although smaller, proved to be sustained throughout the observed period.

Conclusions
ü The low uptake registered by depositors for the early redemption of CEDRO in February 2003 stands out. Furthermore, it is noteworthy as a positive element the significant proportion of CEDRO that were divested and reinvested in the same banks, far exceeding the expectations of the entities.
ü In terms of unavailable deposits, the early return did not produce the expected effects. The total without free availability fell slightly with respect to the total deposits.
ü The effects on fixed-term deposits were clearly positive, registering increases both from the divestment of CEDRO and from the increase in interest rates.
ü Finally, it was detected -ceteris paribus- a differential gain in time deposits for banks that entered the early redemption, while at the same time a lower growth in interest rates operated. Such behaviors could be attributed to a certain improvement in the reputation of this group of entities.
