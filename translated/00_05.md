# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information
 Communiqué No. 37448

Monetary Situation (month of April)

During April the monetary variables continued to present behaviors similar to those that have been observed throughout the year. Deposits maintained the average growth of the previous months, increasing 0.5% ($380 million) with respect to the March average, and in this way accumulated growth of 4.7% during the last 12 months. The increase in deposits resulted from being driven again by fixed-term placements in dollars.

Loans continued stagnant and remained at the March level. Loans directed to the private sector decreased 0.3% ($180 million) and, considering the type of operations, the decline concentrated fundamentally in those of commercial origin. For its part, loans to the public sector increased 1.6% ($200 million).

In this context, interest rates, in general, continued to decline on average and, although they showed increases in the last days of the month, they were located at levels similar to those observed in mid-1999.

Private Banks (data as of February 2000)

Total assets of private banks registered an increase of 2.6% during February 2000, due principally to the increase in the item "Other credits from financial intermediation" (7.0%), which grew due to the greater volume of repo and forward operations, and the greater integration of liquidity requirements with deposit certificates. Available funds also showed a strong increase due to the increase in the integration of liquidity requirements.

Total loans fell $550 million (1.0%), although an important increase in loans to the financial sector was observed. Loans to the local non-financial private sector registered a sharp decline of almost $500 million, basically concentrated in personal loans and other loans, while foreign placements decreased $250 million.

During February, the main sources of funding did not show significant variations, except for interfinancial obligations which grew $350 million (19.6%).

In February 2000, private banks registered profits of 11.1% (annualized) of net equity. This result is significantly greater than that obtained in previous months, due to the strong increase in results from holding financial assets and the decline in administrative expenses. The increase in results from assets is explained basically by the gain derived from the public debt swap carried out on February 10, 2000.

The quality of the credit portfolio deteriorated during February. In this sense, the irregular portfolio in terms of financing increased 0.1 percentage points, reaching 7.3%, while the irregular portfolio net of provisions in terms of financing went from 2.1% to 2.2%. For its part, credit risk, measured as the irregular portfolio net of provisions in terms of net equity, grew from 11.6% to 11.9%.

Total capital requirement of private banks fell almost $300 million (3.6%), basically due to the decrease in total assets computable for capital requirement due to credit risk and, to a lesser extent, to a decrease in the average weighting of non-fixed assets. For its part, capital integration registered a slight increase of $100 million (0.9%). The increase in capital integration, added to the decline in requirement, determined an increase in the excess integration, which in terms of total capital requirement, went from 28.6% to 34.6%. Likewise, capital integration in terms of risk-weighted assets according to Basel verified a slight increase (0.9 percentage points) and continued to remain at a level (18.3%) much higher than that required by local regulation and internationally recommended.
