1. Summary 1 • In September the BCRA completed seventeen consecutive quarters of
 2. Monetary Aggregates 2 compliance with the Monetary Program by placing the means of payment
 (M2) at $136,900 million. This implies that M2 growth over the last 12 months would have again been below the variation of nominal gross domestic product, which reflects the BCRA's commitment to keeping monetary aggregate growth under control.
 3. Banking Liquidity 3 • The average balance of M2 decreased in September, registering declines in both demand deposits in pesos and currency in the hands of the public. The latter behaved throughout the month following its seasonal pattern, although the negative rate of change compared to the previous month implied a significant change in relation to the behavior of the previous 2 years, in which it had recorded increases. The year-on-year growth rate of currency in the hands of the public decreased 1.8 percentage points compared to that observed in August.
 4. Loans 4 • The banking liquidity ratio increased 0.3 percentage points compared to the previous month, reaching a level of 17.6%, similar to that observed in June. For its part, the minimum cash position ended September with a surplus of 0.3% of deposits, with private banks showing significant excess integration, especially during the first half of the month. In this context, the BCRA arranged that for October and November a bimonthly minimum cash position be constituted, which will allow financial entities to obtain better management of their liquidity in an extended time horizon.
 5. Interest Rates 5 • The BCRA continued providing liquidity to the local market through active repos at variable rate, an instrument that it had begun to auction in August. Additionally, as of September 17 it again granted active repos at fixed rate. Added to this, the BCRA continued with the redemption of part of the outstanding stock of LEBACs and NOBACs, both through direct purchases in the secondary market and through repurchase auctions. In this way the character of liquidity reserve that these instruments represent was confirmed. Precisely, to prevent the distortion of said characteristic of liquidity reserve of these monetary regulation instruments, the issuance of internal LEBACs and NOBACs was arranged, which will only be possible to trade locally, seeking to prevent short-term investors from abroad from taking positions in these securities.
 Titles Issued by the BCRA 5 • Based on the aforementioned measures, aimed at demonstrating the capacity and willingness of the BCRA to provide liquidity, when necessary, the interbank market interest rate was strongly reduced in the second half of September, ending the month around 8.5%, while at the same time its volatility also decreased. For its part, interest rates for term placements by private financial entities began to decline in the middle of the month. The BADLAR of private banks ended September at 11.75%, a level similar to that at the end of August.
 Interfinancial Markets 6 • Finally, loans to the private sector, in pesos and in foreign currency, continued showing significant dynamism, increasing during September 3.8% ($3,480 million) and accumulating in the last 12 months a growth of 39.5% in nominal terms.

Means of Payment and GDP In September the BCRA completed seventeen consecutive

7.5 The average balance of M2 decreased in September, recording declines in both demand deposits and currency in circulation. It should be noted that although the latter behaved throughout the month following its seasonal pattern, the rate of change with respect to the previous month was negative at 0.6%, which implied a significant change with respect to the behavior of 2005 and 2006, in which it registered increases of 0.8% and 1.1% respectively. In this way, its year-on-year growth rate decreased 1.8 p.p. with respect to that observed in August (see Graph 2.2).

Regarding the public sector, it was observed that the management of its surplus resources continued to improve, by transferring part of its funds from sight deposits to fixed-term deposits. Nevertheless, the transactional deposits of the public sector continue to represent a significant proportion of total placements and their balance in September exceeded $15,000 million, fueled by the surplus of the different public agencies.

For its part, fixed-term deposits showed an increase of 5.3% in the month, which led the broader aggregate in pesos, M3, to register a monthly increase of 0.7% (around $1,500 million).

Dollar deposits also increased in the month, mainly through fixed-term placements of the private sector, which increased by u$s230 million (see Graph 2.3). It should be noted that after the increase that had been recorded in August, a clear deceleration in the growth of this type of deposits has been observed, especially from the second half of September onward.

In this way, the aggregate M3*, which includes the total of deposits in pesos and dollars and currency in circulation, increased 1% ($2,560 million) in September.

During September the BCRA continued to intensively use monetary regulation instruments as a way to mitigate the adverse effects derived from the international context. The measures adopted by the BCRA were aimed at demonstrating the capacity and willingness of the monetary authority to provide liquidity, in case this should prove necessary. However, it should be emphasized that the solid situation of the financial system has made the full use of such mechanisms unnecessary.

17 It is worth mentioning that for the month of October a bimonthly minimum cash position will be constituted again (October –

 Passive Interest Rates1

 As a result of the implementation of multiple measures by
 the BCRA, during September the upward trend observed since
 late July in passive interest rates was reversed, stemming from the
 precautionary attitude originated in the volatility in international
 markets. In this sense, although in the month the average BADLAR
 interest rate of private banks increased 2.5 p.p. placing itself at
 13%, when analyzing its daily behavior it can be seen that it
 continued to rise during the first weeks of September until reaching
Chart 5.7 a maximum of 14.7% in mid-month, to then begin to decline and
 Interest Rate for Fixed-Term Deposits in Pesos of the Private Sector end the month at 11.75%, a level similar to the end of August (see

 Finally, within the placements of the private sector, the
 main increase was observed in the interest rate of deposits from
 financial services provider companies (AFJP, FCI, insurance
 companies, etc.), which increased in the month by 2.3 p.p..

 interest rates (see Chart 5.9). In this way, a certain flattening of the
Chart 5.9 interest rate curve can be noted, which could be evidencing a perception
 of transitoriness in the rise of the interest rate of this particular line.
