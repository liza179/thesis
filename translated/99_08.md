# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information
Communication No. 35100

The average deposits of July experienced notable growth (approximately $1,700 million) compared to the average of the previous month. This behavior was explained mainly by the inflow of capital induced by the sale of YPF shares at the end of June. The increase in deposits together with greater demand for cash in circulation (July is characterized by significant seasonal demand), explained the strong increase observed in the international reserves of the financial system (US$1,600 million).

Loans to the non-financial private sector continued stagnant, and interest rates presented average levels higher than in recent months, accompanying the increase in sovereign risk.

Between April and May 1999, private banks increased by $1,100 million their external financing through credit lines. This increase was concentrated, as is usual, in a few foreign entities and was used, together with a significant increase in deposits (almost $600 million), to increase mainly holdings of liquid assets. For their part, the total loans granted by private banks showed no variations, although a significant increase was observed in credit directed to the local private sector (just under $400 million).

In May, the monthly profitability of private banks showed a negative value for the second time in the year (1.7% of net equity, in annualized terms). This drop in profits originated in the losses borne by holdings of financial assets. The other variables did not register significant variations.

The quality of the credit portfolio of private banks showed no significant changes, except for a slight deterioration of some indicators. In this sense, the irregular portfolio in terms of financing went from 7.2% to 7.3%, while the irregular portfolio net of provisions in terms of financing remained constant. Between April and May, the greatest deterioration was observed in consumer credit and in small commercial credit (up to $200,000).

The solvency indicators of private banks, calculated based on the position of minimum capital, remained constant. The excess integration remained at 30% of the requirement. MONTHLY MONETARY AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION
