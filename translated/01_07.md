## Monetary Situation (June 2001)

In June, an increase in total deposits was verified, considering average figures, on the order of $670 million (0.8%), driven by the behavior of those belonging to the private sector, which increased $800 million (1.1%). Although a large part of the increase observed in the average figures was a consequence of the "carryover" effect from May, the evolution throughout June was also positive, especially in the last days of the month. Thus, private deposits ended June with growth with respect to end of May of approximately 1%.

It should be recalled that in June a new systemic liquidity regime was implemented, based on two pillars: a requirement for minimum cash on sight operations, to be integrated in the currency of the deposit that gave rise to it; and the maintenance of minimum liquidity requirements for time liabilities. Simultaneously, differential requirement coefficients were established for each of the regimes, associated with the behavior of the different liabilities in times of crisis, and it was permitted to use—for the minimum cash segment—the cash in the vaults of financial entities as integration.

The joint effect of the change in the liquidity regulation, the evolution of liabilities and the policy of the entities, resulted in a slight increase in the total reserves of the entities, which increased approximately $130 million with respect to the average of May. This, combined with the stability of demand for currency in circulation by the public, determined an increase of similar magnitude in the international reserves of the financial system.

Interest rates for operations between financial entities in pesos showed fluctuating behavior, with lower levels in the first half of the month, while those negotiated in dollars remained stable, and in a range between 5% and 6%. For its part, rates for fixed-term deposits remained at high levels, between 11% and 13% in pesos and between 8% and 11% in dollars.

## Private Banks (data as of April 2001)

During April 2001, total assets of private banks decreased 4.4%. The negative evolution of the aforementioned item was fundamentally due to two factors; first, to the fall in total loans by 1.8%—especially those from the private sector—and secondly, to the decrease in the integration of minimum liquidity requirements—which was associated with the reduction of 2 percentage points in the requirement—. It should be noted that the increase observed in the month in the holdings of public securities (16.8%) was linked to the possibility of integrating minimum liquidity requirements with a bond from the national Government maturing in 2002. The decrease in integration together with the change in its composition motivated, to a large extent, the declines registered in the balance sheet items "Other credits from financial intermediation" (12.2%)—which additionally reflected the effect of the decline in other repurchase operations, forward and spot to be settled— and "Available funds" (9.8%). For its part, the net asset of the accounting duplications generated by repurchase operations, forward and spot to be settled, registered a decrease of 1.9%.

As for alternative sources of funding, the lines of loans from abroad and negotiable obligations registered a reduction of 10.1% and 2.5% respectively.
In the first month of the second quarter of 2001, private banks showed profits corresponding to 5.4% of net equity in annualized terms. Although profitability improved compared to the previous month, results continued to be low compared with the first two months of the year. The increase in profits was mainly due to the increase in miscellaneous results, partly offset by higher charges for uncollectibility. Even though the close of the first quarter of 2001 showed very encouraging results with respect to the quarters of the previous year, the beginning of the second quarter of 2001 caused a decline in annualized profitability of 0.6 percentage points. As a consequence, profitability for 2001 accumulated through April reached a value of 7.2% of net equity, in annualized terms.

The total capital requirement of private banks registered an increase of 4.6% in April 2001, derived fundamentally from the increase in capital requirement for credit risk and interest rate (4.5%), which in turn reflected the positive effect of the behavior of risk-weighted assets. In turn, the variation of the latter was due to the increase in the interest rate risk indicator as a consequence of the high active rates operated during April 2001. On the other hand, total capital integration fell 1.1% due to the reduction of basic net equity (1.4%) partly offset by the increase in complementary net equity (3.3%). The aforementioned changes caused the decline in the integration excess, which in terms of total capital requirement went from 54.6% to 46.2%. Finally, total capital integration in terms of risk-weighted assets according to Basel fell 0.5 percentage points, placing itself at a level (20.3%) much higher than what is established by local regulation and by the minimum requirements recommended internationally.
