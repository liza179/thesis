## 2. Monetary Program

In December, the BMA increased $3,406 million, accumulating an annual growth of 9.5% that brought it to $50,647 million. This behavior is explained by the characteristics of peso demand, which has marked positive seasonality in December. The monthly variation of the BMA can be decomposed into the increase of $2,555 million (8.8%) experienced by monetary circulation in the hands of the public and the increase of $851 million (4.7%) in banking reserves in pesos.

The effect on the BMA of operations carried out during the month by the public and financial sectors was practically null, while the external sector continued to be the main factor of monetary expansion (see Graph 2.1).

Since the BCRA took active participation in the development of the repurchase agreement market, financial institutions directed an important portion of their excess liquidity into it, which meant that in 2004 these operations generated a reduction of the BMA of $5,700 million. In December, for the first time in the year, these transactions resulted in an increase of the BMA of $257 million. As a counterpart, the rest of the operations carried out by financial institutions were related to the cancellation of the monthly installment corresponding to the matching, which generated a monetary contraction of similar magnitude to that mentioned for repurchase agreement operations. Therefore, the impact of the financial sector on the BMA in December was null.

Only a small portion of the payments made by the public sector to International Financial Institutions (IFI) was financed with funds that were deposited in local financial entities. As a result, in December, a slight contraction of the BMA of $21 million can be attributed to this sector. However, in the year, they implied a reduction of the BMA of $6,867 million.

The maturities of LEBAC and NOBAC slightly exceeded the placements made. Therefore, the monetary effect of the primary placement of these securities in December was slightly expansive ($37 million), while in the year it explained a monetary contraction of $3,783 million.

To evaluate compliance with the 2004 Monetary Program, it is necessary to consider the BMA adjusted by repurchase agreements, defined as the sum of the BMA and passive repurchase agreements, which showed an increase of $3,125 million (5.9%) and 21.4% year-on-year, reaching $56,171 million. This level is $166 million below the upper limit provided for in the Monetary Program for this month, consequently, 6 consecutive quarters of strict compliance with it were completed (see Graph 2.2).

## 3.1. Interest Rates

In the primary market of securities issued by the BCRA, LEBAC in pesos were incorporated at 1 and 3 months and NOBAC in pesos adjustable and non-adjustable by CER at 4 years, in order to complete the yield curve of these securities. In the repurchase agreement market, the BCRA maintained the corridor of 2.5%-3% in the 7-day segment, while the interest rate of operations between private parties at 1 day continued at levels similar to those of the previous month (2.07%). In both segments, a decrease in the volume traded was observed, which was associated with the low level of operations during days 24 and 31. In the call market also

In December, private monetary aggregates presented growth that was partially compensated by the decrease in public sector placements.

The liquidity ratio for the group of private banks rose by around 1.9 p.p. of deposits (23.8%). Public banks, for their part, registered a decrease in their deposits that resulted in a decrease in their liquidity maintained in passes (the total maintained in current accounts at the BCRA plus cash in banks remained relatively constant). The liquidity ratio for the group of public banks fell by around 1.4 p.p. of deposits (23.5%).

 Throughout the year bank system liquidity remained in a

Public banks were characterized by a marked migration, starting in July, from current accounts at the BCRA towards passive passes with this institution, while private banks kept relatively constant the ratio of bank reserves as a percentage of deposits and poured onto the passes market the extra liquidity surpluses that were accumulating (see Chart 4.3.1).

In the dollar deposits segment, the estimated minimum cash position for December is US$2,000 million, which represents a decrease of US$100 million compared to November, as a result of entities using part of their sight balances at the BCRA to grant dollar loans (see Section 5). It should be noted that although the application of resources (basically linked to pre-financing and export financing) has shown sustained growth throughout the year, the over-integration³ of foreign currency placements is still very broad. Specifically, the group of public banks maintains integrated 90% of their deposits and private banks approximately 75% (see Chart 4.3.2).

## 5. Loans⁴

In December, loans in pesos to the private sector maintained the growth rate they had been showing in recent months, showing an increase of $920 million (2.7%), accumulating a rise of 27.2% throughout the year. Until October, commercial financing represented the main engine of growth, but thanks to the dynamism that personal loans have been presenting, and the growth of credit card financing, in a month of seasonally high consumption, in December they were surpassed by consumer loans (see Chart 5.1). Also observed, for the third time since the crisis broke out, is that loans with real guarantees showed an increase as, just as occurred in September and November, the increasingly greater growth of pawn loans exceeded the increasingly smaller decline in mortgage loans.

In a context of firm growth in the level of activity, commercial loans continue to show a good growth rate, and in December they increased by $380 million (2.6%). As occurred in the two previous months, in December it was the operations related to documents that explained the greater proportion of the increase, which amounted to $190 million (3%), of which approximately 70% corresponded to

³ In accordance with what was established by the BCRA, the failure to apply the lending capacity in foreign currency verified by financial entities in a given period is subject to an equivalent increase in the minimum cash requirement of that period. For this reason, the excess liquidity that financial entities accredit normatively is less than that mentioned in this section in which only the requirement is computed that results from applying reserve coefficients on foreign currency obligations, without considering the increase in the same equivalent to the failure to apply resources.

⁴ The loan figures are adjusted for accounting movements, fundamentally caused by transfers of financial trusts, which although they affect the balances of this balance sheet item do not affect the stock of financing granted. In turn, in November there was a correction of the personal loans series, since a public entity incorporated the financing that it had not been reporting until that moment.

 As in recent months, during the first half of the
 month an important inflow of resources ($620 million) was noted,
 coming largely from AFJP, which was partly offset
 towards the end of the month by the decrease in funds of corporate
 origin, used for the payment of Christmas bonuses. In terms of performance, the

Source: BCRA and CAFCI The fixed income funds also grew in December,
 registering an increase of $32 million, equivalent to a monthly
 variation of 9%. This increase is explained, in part by the influx of
 new resources, mostly institutional and corporate, and in part by
 the increase in the value of the shares of these funds, associated
 with the improvement in the quotation of public securities in the
 portfolio. This latter also had an impact on the return of these
 funds, which increased 8.2 p.p., ending the month at 12.6%.

 Finally, the equity of the mixed income funds
 registered an increase for the sixth consecutive month, of about
 $10 million, which represents a monthly increase of 7%. Most of
 this increase was due, as in the case of variable income and fixed
 income funds, to the improvement in the quotation of its assets in
 the portfolio, which drove up the return of these funds, which went
 from 6% in November to 33% in December.

 The company Edenor S.A. announced the result of the cash
 purchase offer (launched last month) of its financial debt in
