# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information
Communication No. 38388

## Monetary Situation (month of August)

The average stock of deposits in August was 0.5% higher than the average for July, although with dissimilar behaviors between the public and private sectors: while public sector placements decreased in August, as a result of the evolution of the current account, the private sector continued to increase its deposits in the financial system, at an annualized rate of around 11%.

Fixed-term deposits from the private sector, fundamentally in dollars, once again showed the greatest dynamism. If the variation between the average stock of August and the average of March is considered, the average monthly growth rate of this type of placements reaches 1.4%, equivalent to 18% annually.

For their part, deposits linked to transactions, especially savings accounts in the private sector, showed declines in the last month, as a result of seasonal behavior. It should be noted that sight deposits (current accounts and savings accounts) in recent months have remained stable and only move due to seasonality.

Loans to the private sector in August decreased 0.4% with respect to the average of July, although such behavior was influenced by the transfer to order accounts of the uncollectible portfolio (fully provisioned) of an important private bank. If this operation were not considered, loans to the private sector would have remained at the average levels of July. When observing the evolution of each type of operation, dollar-denominated mortgage loans are the ones that have shown the greatest dynamism in recent months (in August they grew at an annualized monthly rate of 18%). As for the public sector, in August it has practically not been financed through the loan market.

The average level of interest rates showed, in general, a slight decrease in August, in a context of stability of international interest rates and country risk - which only increased slightly from the second week of August, without major repercussion on interest rates.

## Private Banks (data as of June 2000)(1)

Total assets of private banks registered an increase of 1.3% during June 2000, basically due to the behavior of the item "Other credits from financial intermediation", which grew 4.2%, by incorporating the increase in time deposit certificates received as a counterparty to repo operations with the Central Bank for the integration of liquidity requirements.

During June, loans to the non-financial private sector registered a decline of $400 million (0.8%), while loans to the public sector increased $600 million (8.9%). If we take into account the decline in loans to the financial sector, the variation in total loans for the month was zero.

Total deposits of private banks rose $600 million (1.1%) in June 2000, principally due to the increase in time deposits in foreign currency. As for alternative sources of funding, lines of loans from abroad fell 8.8%, while negotiable obligations increased 11.1%.

Private banks registered profits of 9.0% (annualized) of net equity during June 2000. Earnings increased compared to the previous month mainly due to the increase in results generated by the holding of financial assets and miscellaneous results. The second quarter of 2000 ends with profits of 5.0% (annualized) of net equity, obtaining a significant improvement compared to the first quarter of the year especially due to the decline in charges for uncollectibility. Despite the gain in the second quarter, losses are recorded in the accumulated result for the first half of 2000 of 3.7% (annualized) of net equity.
(1) As of March 1999, Banco Hipotecario S.A. is included within the group of Private Banks. The quality of the credit portfolio of private banks experienced a slight improvement in June. The irregular portfolio in terms of financings fell 0.1 percentage points, reaching 8.0%, while the irregular portfolio net of provisions in terms of financings went from 1.8% to 1.7%. For its part, credit risk, measured as the irregular portfolio net of provisions in terms of net equity, decreased from 8.9% to 8.6%. It is important to note that although the portfolio of private banks worsened slightly since the beginning of 2000, the credit risk measured as the irregular portfolio net of provisions in terms of net equity fell 2.9 percentage points during the current year.

The total capital requirement of private banks registered a slight increase of $50 million (0.6%), explained by the increase in capital requirement for credit risk. For its part, capital integration did not register changes. The increase in capital requirement caused a fall in the excess of integration, which in terms of total capital requirement went from 53.6% to 52.6%. Likewise, capital integration in terms of risk-weighted assets according to Basel verified a slight fall (0.2 percentage points) and continued to be maintained at a level (20.8%) well above that required by local regulation and internationally recommended.
