## 1. SUMMARY

• Means of payment (M2) registered a monthly average of $132,960 million, in line with the trajectory foreseen in the 2007 Monetary Program.

• In one of the months of the year with the highest foreign currency inflows linked to the liquidation of exports, the BCRA sterilized a large part of the primary expansion of money generated by purchases of foreign currency, using as main instruments the placement of LEBAC and NOBAC and repo operations with the BCRA. Through these instruments the BCRA absorbed $3,867 million. In addition, the entity that still maintains balances for rediscounts canceled the monthly installment provided for in the "matching".

• Time deposits of the private sector presented a decrease of $230 million, a decline that was recorded fundamentally in the first half of the month and was associated with outflows of funds for tax payments, in a month of strong concentration of tax maturities. Thus, the broader aggregate in pesos that includes currency in circulation held by the public and the total of deposits in pesos increased 2.4% during the month.

• Loans to the private sector (in pesos and in foreign currency) continued to show significant dynamism, increasing $2,260 million during May, and in the last 12 months they accumulated an increase of 38.6% in nominal terms. As in recent months, loans with real guarantees show significant dynamism, while consumer financing would be showing a slight deceleration.

• Associated with the concentration of tax payments, in May there was a redistribution of liquidity in favor of public banks that increased their stock of passive repos arranged with the BCRA and to the detriment of private banks that, in turn, reduced them.

• Passive interest rates remained relatively stable throughout the month despite the liquidity redistribution mentioned. On May 2, the BCRA ordered a new increase of 0.25 percentage points for repo interest rates in all segments in which it operates. Thus, in the first five months of 2007 the BCRA increased by 1 percentage point the reference interest rates for 7-day terms.

• Likewise, the BCRA introduced a new instrument to the market of securities it issues. On May 22 it began offering 4-year NOBAC that pay variable coupon based on the BADLAR rate of private banks. Among NOBAC, it was the most placed species in the latest auctions and for which the largest number of offers were received. In the last auction of the month the margin paid in its placement was 2.3 percentage points.

• The stock of international reserves exceeded US$40,000 million and increased US$1,975 million (5.1%) during the month.

• In May 2007 the Rest CPI (approximation to underlying inflation) continued showing monthly rates lower than those of the same period in 2006, so that the rate of year-on-year growth was reduced to 9.8%.

 again, generating an increase in fixed-term deposits of the

 In May the BCRA introduced a new instrument to
 the securities market it issues. The 4-year NOBACs, which pay
 variable coupon based on the BADLAR rates of private banks
 began to be offered in the auction on the 22nd. Among the
 NOBACs, it was the most placed species in the latest auctions and the
 one for which the largest number of offers were received. In the last
 auction of the month the margin paid in its placement was 2.3 p.p.. On the
 other hand, the rest of the interest rates did not show significant

The advance interest rate remained relatively stable. Although in the middle of the month it presented a slight increase of 0.3 percentage points accompanied by an increase in the volume granted, this behavior subsequently reversed while the stock remained unchanged.

The average interest rate was 15.0%, thus continuing at a level lower than that presented during the last year. In contrast, for documents granted on signature alone, the interest rate decreased 0.4 percentage points, standing at 12.6% (see Graph 5.7).

For financings with real guarantee, the interest rate on mortgage loans was 11.4%, maintaining the same level as the previous month. While in pledge loans the interest rate presented an increase of 0.2 percentage points, standing at 11.1%.

Finally, the interest rates on consumer loans recorded a slight decline. In this way, for personal loans the interest rate was 25.3%, decreasing 0.2 percentage points with respect to the previous month, and for credit card financings the interest rate corresponding to April, the latest available information, decreased 0.1 percentage points, standing at 25.7%.

## 6. International Reserves and Foreign Exchange Market⁷

The level of international reserves was US$40,581 million on May 31, accumulating an increase of US$1,975 million (5.1%) in the month (see Graph 6.1).

**Graph 6.1**
International Reserves of the BCRA
(gold, foreign currency and term placements)

This increase is explained mainly by the inflow of foreign currency purchased in the Single and Free Exchange Market (MULC) by the BCRA, which totaled US$1,770 million. The remainder of the increase was given by operations of the public sector, the yield on reserves, and the inflow of revolving funds. On the other hand, negative variations were given mainly by a decrease in dollar accounts of financial entities at the Central Bank and the valuation of the exchange rate.

In the foreign exchange market, the wholesale quotation of the peso with respect to the dollar (Reference) appreciated 0.3%, where the monthly average exchange rate was 3.0794 $/US$. Similarly, the peso appreciated with respect to the Euro by 0.4% with an average quotation of 4.163 $/Euro. On the contrary, the peso again had a depreciation with respect to the Real of 2.1%.

Regarding the volume traded, in the spot market the average daily volume, through the Electronic Operations System - SIOPEL- and the Electronic Brokerage Market -MEC-, remained similar to the previous month at US$475 million, with BCRA participation of 8.2%. In the futures market the volume traded showed an increase of 62% compared to the previous month.

 During May, financial trusts (FF) for just over $500 million were placed, an amount slightly higher than that of the previous month and that of the same month a year ago (see Chart 7.7). In the first 5 months of the year, issuances amounted to approximately $2,900 million, a figure similar to that accumulated in the same period a year ago, although around double that registered in those months of 2005.

CREDIT CARDS AND FINANCIAL TRUSTS

The main fiduciaries on this occasion were retail merchants and financial institutions not regulated by the BCRA, which concentrated 38% and 34% of what was issued, respectively, followed by banks, with 19% (see Chart 7.8). The remaining fiduciaries, which concentrated the remaining 9%, corresponded to a consortium of companies holding concessions for a hydroelectric complex and to SMEs.

**Distribution of FF Fiduciaries:**
- Retail Merchants: 38%
- Non-Regulated Financial Institutions: 34%
- Banks: 19%
- Retail Loans: 7%
- Commercial Credits: 2%
- Other Financial Entities: 7%
- Credit Cards: 20%
- Personal Loans: 71%
- Cash Flows: 20%

The interest rates at cutoff remained relatively stable during the month (see Chart 7.9, left quadrant). In effect, the interest rate on senior titles with fixed rates stood at 9.7% in May, barely 0.1 p.p. higher than recorded in April. The interest rate on species adjustable according to BADLAR rose 0.7 p.p. compared to the minimum reached in April, to stand at 10.2%.

The average duration of senior FF titles issued was reduced in one month to reach a minimum of 6 months in May (see Chart 7.9, right quadrant), which is a product of the greater relative weight of the placements of species that have consumer financing as underlying, with shorter durations. Although the duration of senior titles that have personal loans as underlying was also slightly reduced, to 6.1 months.
