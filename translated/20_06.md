## 1. Summary

In June, the broad monetary aggregate M3 private, adjusted for seasonality, showed an average monthly increase of 6.1% in nominal terms, which is equivalent to real growth of 4%. In this way, it continued moderating its expansion rate, following the strong growth observed in April.

Among its components, time deposits stood out. The measures adopted by the BCRA, establishing minimum interest rates, resulted in sustained growth of time deposits, which became more pronounced from mid-May, when the minimum remuneration also began to apply to legal entities. In this way, time deposits completed an average monthly nominal increase of 11.9%, (9.7% in real terms), one of the highest in recent years.

The BCRA decided to raise, as of June, the minimum interest rate that financial entities must pay for time deposits in pesos from the private sector, from 70% to 79% of the monetary policy rate, seeking to guarantee households and companies a positive return in real terms. Thus, the minimum interest rate was set at 30.02% n.a., equivalent to 34.52% a.a.

Loans in pesos to the private sector, although they moderated their growth rate compared to that observed in April and May, continued to expand at a historically high rate. In nominal terms and without seasonality, the expansion recorded in June was 4% monthly (1.9% at constant prices). Commercial financing continued to be the main explanatory factor for loan growth, followed by credit card financing, which received a boost from zero-rate loans granted to sole proprietors and self-employed workers.

The BCRA continued to adopt measures to promote credit to MSMEs. Thus, it extended the deduction of the minimum cash requirement for those entities that grant financing at the subsidized rate of 24% to non-MSME companies insofar as those funds are intended for the acquisition of machinery and equipment produced by local MSMEs. For its part, the main line for MSMEs and Service Providers accumulated, as of the end of June, disbursements of $282,909 million, of which $7,000 million corresponded to health service providers. In turn, the amount granted through the MSME Plus line, intended for small and medium-sized enterprises without bank financing, was around $930 million.

Regarding zero-rate credits, intended for sole proprietors and self-employed workers, in June 413,548 loans were granted for a total amount of $49,923 million. Because this line provides that the accreditation of funds be done in three consecutive months, only $27,145 million pesos were credited. For its part, 131,515 new cards were issued for the accreditation of these funds, since the regulation contemplates the issuance of a new card in case the client does not have one with the entity. It should be noted that the deadline for requesting said credits was extended until July 31.

The statistical closing of this report was July 2, 2020.

Monetary Report | June 2020 | BCRA | 12. Monetary Aggregates
In June, the broad private aggregate M3¹, adjusted for seasonality, presented an average monthly increase of 6.1% in nominal terms, which is equivalent to real growth of 4%². In this way, it continued moderating its expansion rate, following the strong growth observed in April. Among its components, fixed-term deposits stood out, which after several months of presenting limited variations, explained the majority of the month's increase (see Charts 2.1).

The measures adopted by the BCRA to encourage savings in pesos, establishing minimum interest rates, resulted in sustained growth of fixed-term deposits, which was more pronounced from mid-May, when the minimum remuneration began to apply also to legal entities. By breaking down the balance by amount bracket, it can be verified that the boost came, mainly, from placements of more than $1 million (see Chart 2.2). On the other hand, it is worth noting that deposits in UVA showed a downward trend in June, explained by both traditional placements as well as early-repayment ones. In this way, fixed-term deposits completed an average monthly nominal increase of 11.9%, (9.7% in real terms), one of the highest of recent years. In terms of GDP³, these placements represented 6.7%, accumulating an increase of 1.9 p.p. in the first half of the year. This ratio was among the highest in the series, close to the maximums observed at the beginning of 2016 and 2019 (see Chart 2.3).

Chart 2.2  Chart 2.3

From mid-June onwards, growth began to be recorded in fixed-term placements linked to the dollar value, after the BCRA implemented changes in relation to fixed-term deposits with variable remuneration⁴. On one hand, the BCRA decided that exchange rate risk coverage will not be required in fixed-term investments with variable remuneration based on the US dollar. On the other hand, it determined that fixed-term investments with variable remuneration with returns determined based on the value of cereals, oilseeds and the US dollar quote, will be limited to individuals—natural or legal persons—with agricultural activity and for an amount of up to 2 times the total value of their cereal and/or oilseed sales registered from November 1, 2019 onwards.

³ For the calculation of the fixed-term deposits/GDP ratio, the 3-month moving average GDP was used.
⁴ [Footnote reference in original text]
Regarding means of payment, currency in circulation held by the public showed an increasing trend throughout the entire month, reflecting persistent precautionary demand for money in the context of uncertainty generated by the pandemic. However, it grew at a slower rate than in April and May, registering an average monthly increase of 5.2% in nominal terms and without seasonality (3.1% adjusted for expected inflation). For its part, demand deposits remained relatively stable during the first three weeks of the month; a period in which the second installment of the Emergency Family Income (IFE)5 was paid, along with other social assistance, mitigating the usual decline in the first part of the month. Meanwhile, these placements increased toward the end of the month, during the period of salary and bonus payments. Considering values adjusted for seasonality, the average growth for the month of demand deposits was 2.7% nominal, while it is estimated that in real terms they grew only 0.7% after more significant variations during the first months of the year and with a historical maximum variation in April. Thus, considering the series without seasonality, private M2 moderated its expansion rate, presenting an average monthly increase of 3.9% in nominal terms and 1.8% at constant prices (see Charts 2.5 and 2.6).

Monetary Report | June 2020 | BCRA | 3 For its part, the Monetary Base exhibited an average monthly contraction of 1.5% ($32,140 million) (see Chart 2.7). The increase in the stock of Repos and LELIQ, together with some public sector operations, counteracted the expansionary monetary effect associated, fundamentally, with Temporary Advances and the Transfer of Profits to the National Treasury. It is worth noting that the transfer of funds from the current accounts of financial entities at the BCRA to LELIQ was motivated by certain regulatory changes; such as the possibility of expanding the excess admitted position of LELIQ for those entities that pay the minimum passive rate of 30.02% n.a. and the option to meet the entire minimum cash requirement in pesos of time deposits and investments with LELIQ ("see Liquidity Section").

Finally, in the foreign currency segment, the balance of deposits from the private sector stood at US$16,780 million at the end of the month. Thus, they halted the decline observed since mid-April, remaining relatively stable during June.

3. Loans to the private sector

In June, loans in pesos to the private sector continued to expand at a historically high rate, although they moderated their growth rate compared to April and May (see Chart 3.1). Thus, in nominal terms and without seasonality, the expansion was 4% monthly (1.9% at constant prices). In this way, loans in pesos to the private sector accumulated since March a growth of 20.4% nominal s.e. (10.8% real) and of 44.5% (-0.4% real) compared to the same period of the previous year.

Commercial financing continued to be the main factor explaining the growth of loans, followed by credit card financing, which unlike what occurred in the previous months, contributed positively to the expansion (see Chart 3.2). The demand for credit from companies continued to be linked to the need for funds to cover the payment of salaries and bonuses, as well as to maintain working capital stock. Overall, commercial lines registered a monthly expansion of 5.3% without seasonality, with a year-on-year variation of 120% (51.8% at constant prices). Within these,

Single-signature documents continued to be the main vehicle through which credit was channeled, while a gradual growth continued to be observed in the balance of discounted documents. Meanwhile, current account advances showed a declining trend throughout the month (see Chart 3.3).

Chart 3.2 Chart 3.3

This occurred in a context in which some areas of the country were under the system of "Social Distancing, Preventive and Mandatory" (DISPO) and other regions continued with "Social Isolation, Preventive and Mandatory" (ASPO)⁶. In the DISPO zone, a greater number of sectors were able to resume the development of their commercial activity, while in the ASPO zone towards the end of the month a reduction in authorized activities was ordered⁷.

The BCRA continued to carry out an active credit policy aimed at mitigating the economic impact of the crisis generated by the health emergency. Thus, it decided to extend, effective from July, the reduction in reserve requirements for financial entities that provide financing at the subsidized rate of 24% to non-SME companies to the extent that those funds are destined for the acquisition of machinery and equipment produced by local SMEs⁸ (see "Liquidity Section").

In particular, the line for SMEs⁹ and Health Service Chart 3.4
Providers accumulated, at the end of the month,
disbursements of $282,909 million, of which
$7,000 million corresponded to health service
providers. The remainder, which corresponds to
financing for SMEs, was distributed as follows:
48% to working capital (excluding salaries),
26% to salary payment and the remaining 26%
to other destinations (see Chart 3.4). Additionally,
$11,600 million was approved, which has not yet
been disbursed, while applications for $9,600
million were registered which are in the approval
process.

On the other hand, the SME Plus line, intended for small and medium-sized companies without bank financing, served 1,622 companies at the end of the month, of which 1,045 did so with FOGAR guarantees. The total amount granted was $928 million. Additionally, $340 million was approved but has not yet been disbursed.

Regarding zero-rate credits, intended for self-employed workers and independent contractors, in June, 413,548 loans were granted for a total amount of $49,923 million. Because this line provides that the accreditation of funds be made in three consecutive monthly installments, only $27,145 million pesos were credited. In the same period, 131,515 new cards were issued for the accreditation of these funds, since the regulation contemplates the issuance of a new card in case the client does not have one with the entity. It should be noted that the deadline for requesting said credits was extended until July 31.

Furthermore, continuing with the policy of relieving the financial burden on the private sector in the current context, the BCRA extended until September 30 the measure that established that the unpaid balance of financial entity financing be incorporated at the end of the life of the credit. For this operation, entities will only be able to charge the contractual compensatory interest. This measure is transversal to the credit market, with the exception of credit card financing¹⁰.

Regarding loans more associated with consumption, the behavior was not homogeneous. On one hand, credit cards grew 6.6% s.e. in nominal terms, equivalent to an increase of 4.5% real. Part of the increase is explained by the rise in accreditations of zero-rate loans (see Graph 3.5). Various measures previously taken could also have influenced its performance, such as the expansion of the categories covered by the "Ahora 12" program and the establishment of a maximum rate for these financing at 43% n.a. On the other hand, personal loans showed a slight decline in the month (0.3% s.e. nominal).

**Graph 3.6** Regarding lines with real guarantee, pledged loans presented a monthly increase of 1.3% in nominal terms and without seasonality, after 21 consecutive months without positive variations (-16.4% y.o.y.; see Graph 3.6). This reversal in the trend is linked to the evolution of automobile sales. According to the report from the Association of Automobile Dealerships of the Argentine Republic (ACARA), in June a marked increase in vehicle sales (in units) was observed that was positioned 74.3% above the previous figure and 2.3% above the figure for the same period of the previous year. On the other hand, mortgage financing maintained null growth, both in monthly and year-over-year terms. Unlike what occurred with automobiles, this market remains with a very small number of operations.

Finally, loans in foreign currency to the private sector continued to decrease. The monthly decline was 6.5% (US$522 million), accumulating a contraction of 53% compared to last July (last maximum of the series). This contraction of dollar loans continued to respond almost entirely to the behavior of documents with sole signature.

# 4. LIQUIDITY OF FINANCIAL ENTITIES

During the month of June, the growth of deposits exceeded that of loans. As a consequence, broad banking liquidity in local currency (which includes current accounts at the BCRA, cash in banks, balances of repos arranged with the BCRA, holdings of LELIQ, eligible bonds to integrate reserve requirements and NOCOM) registered an increase of 0.7 p.p. and averaged 64.5% of deposits (see Graph 4.1). As in previous months, movements in the composition of liquidity responded to regulatory changes ordered by the BCRA.

The composition of BCRA's remunerated liabilities turned in favor of LELIQ to the detriment of passive repos. This was because, on one hand, effective from June financial entities that capture deposits at the minimum rate of 79% of the LELIQ rate can expand the excess position in LELIQ by 18% of the average daily balance of the previous month of placements at term of the non-financial private sector in pesos and those constituted by the National government, provincial, City of Buenos Aires and/or municipal governments¹¹. On the other hand, since mid-May entities can integrate with LELIQ the totality of the requirement for minimum cash in pesos of term deposits and investments (with the exception of what can be integrated with National Treasury Bonds)¹². This was reflected in a decrease in current accounts, with the increase in LELIQ for integration as a counterpart, given that in the month of May it was only applicable for 14 days while in June the effect was full.

Additionally, integration of minimum cash was permitted with "National Treasury Bonds in pesos at fixed rate maturing May 2022"¹³, which were auctioned at the end of May. This generated in June a slight increase of this component in terms of deposits.
For its part, cash in banks registered a decline of 0.3 p.p. in terms of deposits.
Thus, following the strong increase observed in April, it continued with the normalization process
begun in May and returned to levels close to its historical average.

Finally, it is worth mentioning other changes in the minimum cash regime that will come into effect
starting next month. First, the unified calculation of minimum cash positions in pesos for the July/August and December of one year/January of the following year periods was eliminated14. Furthermore, as was mentioned in the "Loans" Section, in order to continue promoting credit to the productive sector, the deduction of minimum cash in pesos corresponding to financing granted at an interest rate of up to 24% was expanded, including a special tranche for large companies that invest in capital goods produced by national MSMEs15.

Monetary Report | June 2020 | BCRA | 8 Chart 4.2 In a context of falling loans in dollars and stable deposits, banking liquidity in foreign currency continued to increase and averaged 69.8% of deposits. The increase was concentrated in cash in banks, while current accounts at the BCRA, in terms of deposits, showed a decline (see chart 4.2).

5. Interest Rates

The BCRA decided to raise, starting in June, the floor of the interest rate that financial entities must pay for time deposits in pesos from the private sector, from 70% to 79% of the monetary policy rate, seeking to guarantee households and companies a positive return in real terms16. This provision is mandatory for financial entities in Group A and branches of foreign banks classified as systemically important (G-SIB), while for the remaining entities it is optional. Likewise, it was provided that financial entities that capture deposits at the minimum interest rate may expand their net position exceeding LELIQ (see "Liquidity" Section).

Thus, the minimum interest rate for deposits in pesos from the private sector went from 26.6% n.a. to 30.02% n.a., and in effective terms, it increased from 31.1% to 34.52%. Passive rates reflected these changes, remaining throughout the month around these values, both in the case of the rate paid to retail savers and in that corresponding to the wholesale segment (see Chart 5.1). It should be clarified that the benefit of the minimum rate does not extend to companies that have accessed financing lines at the subsidized rate of 24%. For its part, active interest rates showed heterogeneous behaviors. Among those applied to commercial financing, both the rate applied to document discounts and that of sole signature documents registered increases of around 1.5 p.p. and 1.3 p.p. on average, standing at 26.7% and 30%, respectively. In contrast, the rate on total advances averaged 34.6% in June, almost 1 p.p. less than in May. Finally, the interest rate charged for personal loans remained relatively stable, averaging 50.2% (see Chart 5.2).

Chart 5.2

In this way, the spread of short-term active rates, which are those that respond quickly to changes in market conditions, with respect to the BADLAR private banks - interest rate for fixed-term deposits of $1 million and more, 30 to 35 days – decreased significantly since late April, following the imposition of minimum rates on deposits, to remain relatively stable throughout June.

6. International Reserves
As of the end of June, the balance of international reserves of the Central Bank was situated at US$43,241 million, which implied an increase of US$653 million with respect to the close of the previous month (see Graph 6.1). Said increase was explained by net purchases of foreign currency by the BCRA and net disbursements with International Organizations, while the minimum cash accounts registered a decrease.

The nominal peso/US dollar exchange rate increased 2.8% between the end of May and the end of June, concluding the month at 70.46. The multilateral real exchange rate, for its part, experienced a slight depreciation until closing the month at a value of 115.8, remaining relatively stable since mid-March (see Graph 6.2).
