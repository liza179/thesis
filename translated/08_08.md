The statistical closing of this report was on September 10, 2008. All figures are provisional and subject to revision¹. Synthesis¹

• In August, time deposits from the private sector registered an increase of $2,620 million (4.3%). 40% of monthly growth was explained by the rise in retail deposits (less than $1 million), which continued with the upward trajectory they resumed from the end of May.

• The monetary aggregate M2 was located at $157,480 million, registering year-on-year growth of 13% (similar to that registered by private M2). The deceleration in the demand for means of payment was driven mainly by the aforementioned good performance shown by time placements, both public and private. In particular, currency in circulation held by the public decreased $690 million (1%). Thus, the broad monetary aggregate M3 in pesos (which includes currency in circulation held by the public and the total of deposits in pesos) increased $2,990 million (1.1%) and was located at $267,270 million.

• Financial entities continued showing significant liquidity levels. The banking liquidity ratio —defined as cash in banks, current accounts of banks at the BCRA and repos payable to the BCRA, as a percentage of deposits in pesos— presented an average level of 21.1%, 0.6 p.p. above the average of the previous month. When also considering holdings of LEBAC and NOBAC, the broader liquidity ratio stood at 39%. Additionally, the minimum cash position of the system ended with a surplus of 0.4% of total deposits in pesos, barely higher than the previous months.

• Part of the liquidity of financial entities continued being directed to the repo market with the Central Bank, in which the diversity of available monetary regulation instruments was expanded, by incorporating new terms. In fact, active and passive repos at 14, 21 and 28 days were added, in addition to the already existing terms of 1 and 7 days.

• In the aforementioned context, short-term interest rates in the monetary market decreased. In the interbank loan market in pesos, the interest rate was reduced 0.5 p.p., averaging 8.7% for the month. Additionally, the BADLAR rate for private banks averaged August at 12.3%, with a decline of 2.6 p.p. with respect to July. In line with this, for the second consecutive month short-term active rates declined and, in particular, those associated with financing for commercial activity. The average interest rate for advances fell with respect to July by 2.5 p.p. standing at 19.4%, while the average of interest rates for loans granted in the form of unsecured promissory notes decreased 2.6 p.p. standing at 17.7%.
• Total loans to the private sector, in pesos and in foreign currency, showed an increase of 1.5% ($1,880 million). Although they continued to soften their expansion, varying in year-on-year terms by 33% compared to 35% in the previous month, the current monthly increase turned out to be considerably higher than that observed in the two previous months. Given that the increase was observed fundamentally from the second half of August, considering end-of-month figures, the increase reached $2,700 million.

Monetary Report / August 2008 | BCRA | 3 2. Monetary Aggregates1

In August, the monetary aggregate M2 was located at $157,480 million, registering a year-on-year variation of 13%. The impulse presented by fixed-term deposits during this month explained to a large extent the monthly decrease of $3,740 million in total M2.

In particular, currency in circulation held by the public decreased by $690 million (1%).

For its part, the broad monetary aggregate M3 in pesos (which includes currency in circulation held by the public and the total of deposits in pesos) increased by $2,990 million (1.1%) and was located at $267,270 million.

The main sources of creation of M3 were the Central Bank's foreign currency purchases and the increase in loans to the private sector. In turn, this Institution continued to provide liquidity through the LEBAC and NOBAC market, with which the decrease in the outstanding balance of these securities also contributed to meeting the demand for monetary resources. For its part, the public sector appeared as a factor of monetary contraction due to the transfer of funds in pesos that it made from its accounts in the banking system to those in the Central Bank.

Moving on to consider the components of M3, it is observed that private fixed-term deposits grew by $2,620 million (4.3%). 40% of the monthly growth was explained by the increase in retail deposits (less than $1 million), which continued with the upward trajectory that they resumed from late May. In this way, when analyzing the evolution of deposits estimated based on information available for Capital and Greater Buenos Aires, it is noted that the balance of fixed-term deposits of families reached at the end of August the level it had registered on April 23, when they had begun to fall (see Chart 2.2). On the other hand, wholesale deposits also continued to increase, with a high participation both of financial service providers and the rest of companies. In turn, various public agencies also allocated surplus resources toward fixed-term deposits, which explained the 14% increase in peso-denominated fixed-term placements by the public sector.

On the other hand, in the foreign currency segment, deposits increased by US$260 million. This growth was explained by the increase in private placements, which were driven by the payment of public debt securities services denominated in dollars, at the beginning of the month. In this way, the aggregate M3*, which includes the total of deposits in local and foreign currency and currency in circulation held by the public, increased by $3,880 million (1.3%).

Banks continued directing an important part of their excess resources to the repo market with the Central Bank. In effect, the average balance of passive repos for this Institution increased $1,400 million, when considering repos arranged under all the modalities in which the Central Bank operates (REPO round, overnight operations and mutual funds). On the other hand, no new active repo operations were recorded and the average balance for August was placed at the same level as the end of July, $157 million.

Expanding the diversity of monetary regulation instruments available and completing the yield curve in the shortest-term segment, in order to provide greater information to the market, the Central Bank incorporated new terms for repo operations. In fact, active and passive repos were added at 14, 21 and 28 days, in addition to the usual terms of 1 and 7 days (see Table 5.1).

**Interbank Market (call)**

In August the interest rate of the interbank market was reduced by 0.5 percentage points, averaging 8.7% for the month. This decline can be attributed to the high level of liquidity that the system maintained (see Section 3. Bank Liquidity).

In turn, the average interest rate for one-business-day operations was placed at 8.6%, which implied a decline of 0.3 percentage points with respect to the previous month (see Graph 5.2). The amounts traded in this segment averaged the month at a value above $600 million, which implied a decline of $90 million with respect to July.

The deviation of interest rates for call operations with respect to their daily average was placed at 1 percentage point, on average in August, 1.3 percentage points less than in July (see Graph 5.3). This decrease was a reflection of the stability of monetary market conditions.

**Passive Interest Rates**

During August the passive interest rates remained stable both in the wholesale segment and in the retail segment, reflecting the permanence of financial system liquidity indicators at adequate levels. In effect, the BADLAR rate for private banks ended August at 12.2%, with a slight decline of 0.5 percentage points with respect to the last data from July (see Graph 5.4), while its monthly average was placed at 12.3% with a decline of 2.6 percentage points with respect to the average of July. On the other hand, some stability was also observed in the interest rates paid by private banks for retail placements (for amounts less than $100,000), which reached a level of 11.3% monthly average weighted by the amount traded at the end of August, similar to that recorded in the last data from July. In this way, the spread of interest rates for the different amount brackets remained stable.

Additionally, when analyzing interest rates by type of depositor in the most relevant bracket (30 to 59 days)...

Active interest rates showed dissimilar movements, highlighting the decline for the second consecutive month of those belonging to the short-term strata, in line with the fall in passive interest rates.

(Average interest rate monthly weighted by amount)

Active interest rates showed average movements dissimilar, highlighting the decline for the second consecutive month of those belonging to the short-term strata, in line with the fall in passive interest rates.

The average interest rates of financing associated with commercial activity showed declines, as was observed during last month. The average interest rate for advances fell compared to the July average by 2.5 p.p., placing itself at 19.4%, while the average of interest rates for loans granted in the form of documents signed only fell 2.6 p.p., placing itself at 17.7% (see Chart 5.6). The fall of these rates was evident mainly in the first two weeks of the month. With respect to the interest rates on loans related to consumption, the one corresponding to personal loans presented an increase of 2.2 p.p., reaching an average value for August of 36%. For its part, the interest rates of credit card financing corresponding to July rose 2.4 p.p., reaching an average value of 29.1%. Finally, the interest rate of financing with pledge guarantee was placed at 21.3%, with a slight increase of 0.2 p.p. compared to the July average.

International Reserves and GDP
thousands of millions of US$ %

The stock of international reserves totaled US$47,090 million at the end of August, presenting a decrease in the month of 1%. It is worth mentioning that despite this, the balance of international reserves continued to be placed at historically elevated levels when considered both in terms of the product (see Chart 6.1), as well as other relevant variables (short-term financial and commercial debt, monetary aggregates). Operations of the public sector were the factor that explained to a greater extent the monthly decrease, since they implied a fall in reserves of US$1,155 million, associated fundamentally with the payment of debt services in foreign currency in early August. Meanwhile, as in July, the Central Bank was a net buyer of foreign currency in the Unified and Free Foreign Exchange Market (MULC), so through these operations international reserves increased US$645 million.

In the foreign exchange market, the quotation of the peso with respect to the wholesale Dollar (Reference) remained practically stable with a slight depreciation in the month of 0.4%, when registering an average quotation of 3.03 $/US$ (see Chart 6.2). Meanwhile, with respect to the Euro,

Regarding the private debt market, in August financing through negotiable obligations (ON) was carried out through three placements. The first, carried out by Probenefit SA, was for a nominal value of US$4 million. The others corresponded to SME ON issuances. One of them was issued by Alvarez Hermanos SAC. –a company dedicated to the importation, purchase, division and milling of spices for food– for an amount of US$300 thousand and for a term of 2 years. The last, carried out by Savant Pharm SA., was for a total amount of US$1 million and with maturity at 3 years. Both SME ONs pay a fixed rate of 9.85% and 8.50% respectively.

Additionally, in August a new Short-Term Debt Security issuance was recorded corresponding to Banco Finansur, for a total of $25 million, placed at 180 days and paying variable rate according to the BADLAR of private banks.

The total of the Pension and Retirement Fund (FJP) reached mid-August at $96,970 million, showing in the last month an advance of 0.2% ($200 million).

Income in the form of contributions to the Pension and Retirement Fund Administrators (AFJP) for the month of July amounted to approximately $1,340 million, being higher than those in other periods as a consequence of the receipt of half of the annual supplementary salary, which generates a higher level of contributions by workers.

The investment portfolio, with $96,020 million, presented in the last thirty days under analysis an expansion of 0.4% ($390 million). This increase was

In this way, with the sharp decrease recorded in the holding of FCI from MERCOSUR, the administrators reached ahead of schedule the 4% limit established in these placements for the end of August (see Graph 7.3).

Finally, it remains that in the coming months the administrators increase their placements in investments related to the real economy, which currently represent approximately 0.02% of the FJP. Various infrastructure projects that would be financed with FJP resources are in the process of analysis or implementation. In this way, they would comply with the partial goal of 1% established for October 2008 by last year's pension reform.

 fixed placement costs given the decrease in net income

 FF market activity is expected to depend on the type of

 Despite the particular circumstances of the month, the
 underlying securitized assets continued to be mostly
 those linked to consumption (personal loans and credit
 card coupons), which represented 93% of the total (see
 Chart 7.6).

 sense, it is likely that at the moment when Decree
