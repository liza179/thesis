## Monetary Report
## October 2002

During October, following the trend of recent months, the local monetary market showed positive developments in a stable macroeconomic context that was manifested in a significant reduction in the inflation rate – the lowest since the abandonment of convertibility – and stability in the foreign exchange market.

Financial entities saw their deposits increase and, simultaneously, experienced net credit cancellations. This behavior resulted in sustained recovery of liquidity in the financial system, which for the first time in the year did not require assistance from the Central Bank.

Within this framework, there was a significant increase in the Central Bank's international reserves, which reached mid-June levels. Likewise, and as a sterilization policy, the governing entity carried out placements of LEBACs that resulted in a reduction in short-term interest rates and an increase in the terms of agreements.

## Deposits

In October, and for the third consecutive month, deposits from the private sector in the Argentine financial system showed an increase ($1,260 million equivalent to 2.3%). This behavior is extremely encouraging in a month in which banks had to return rescheduled deposits.

As of October 1, financial entities were obligated to return rescheduled deposits up to $7,000 and were authorized to make returns of certificates of up to $10,000. It was estimated that the effect of this measure would be a deposit decline of around $1,000 million (approximately 5% of the CEDROs stock as of September 30) if all depositors withdrew their placements from the system (approximately $1,500 million if the CER adjustment is included). The payment of precautionary measures that financial entities had been making determined a monetary outlook at the beginning of the month in which the possibility of significant liquidity needs for the entities was foreseen. However, this did not happen and, as mentioned, an increase in private placements was observed.

An issue to keep in mind is that, given expectations regarding exchange rate and inflation variations, the interest rates offered by banks turned out to be very attractive. In fact, fixed-term deposits constituted one of the most profitable investment alternatives of the month. Additionally, and equally important as an explanation for deposit performance, the improvement in the perception of the banking system by economic agents can be mentioned.

Rescheduled deposits (CEDROs) were reduced in October fundamentally as a consequence of the disaffiliations mentioned. It should be clarified that although a new CEDRO exchange was in effect during the month (now extended for 30 days), the entities have not yet accounted for what was exchanged up to that point, so the available figures do not allow inference of the results thereof.

Fixed-term deposits in the free segment increased almost $1,300 million (30%) during the month under analysis, increasing their participation in total deposits from 4% to 10% between June and October. Deposits of approximately 30 days maturity gained participation in the total, coming to represent 60% of the placements at term in this segment – an increase of 6 percentage points since end of June. For their part, deposits at short terms maintained their participation at around 20% throughout the last months.

If we observe the behavior of free fixed-term deposits by bank group, it can be noted that in October much of the growth was distributed between public banks and private banks with majority foreign capital, representing between the two groups almost 70% of the month's variation.

Like free deposits, deposits in the "corralito" segment also presented sustained growth and in October increased around $1,600 million (7%) observing the increase fundamentally in placements at term, at 30 days. As we have mentioned on other occasions, the "corralito" is fed, among other operations, by the liquidation of exports which is carried out through the BCRA and through which these funds are credited to current accounts in this segment.

Injunctions

As in previous months, injunction resources represented a negative factor in the evolution of deposits in the non-financial private sector. It is estimated that, until the 25th day of the month under analysis, the balance of financial institutions' placements decreased by approximately $290 million due to the implementation of said precautionary measures. Additionally, the adjustment corresponding to the updating of deposits through the reference stabilization coefficient (CER) was $110 million in October. Finally,

the disbursement of deposits originally in foreign currency, in effective dollars, or at the market exchange rate generated additional liquidity needs close to $340 million.

Loans

Continuing with the trend that has dominated during the present year, in October the balance of loans to the non-financial private sector observed a total decrease in absolute terms similar to the fall recorded in the previous month, approximately $900 million (-2.6%). However, it is worth mentioning that, if we exclude from the analysis what happened in the credits granted through the current account advances modality, it is possible to perceive a new generalized deceleration in the pace of decline of the remaining credit lines.

observed significant differences in the evolution of this item among the different entities according to the origin of capital –public, national private, foreign private– as well as their relative size. In particular, with respect to this latter type of characterization, and adopting a definition of size in terms of the balance of loans granted in effect at the beginning of the period, both the largest entities and the relatively small ones registered a variation that did not differ significantly from the sector average.

 In terms of the type of loan according to its purpose, and as has been happening in the preceding months, during the current month the financing corresponding to the consumer portfolio was the one that registered a relatively greater fall. This type of loan explained, in aggregate terms, just over 60% of the total variation in private loans. Again mortgage and personal loans observed the main decreases, while financing through credit cards further decelerated its net fall. On the side of commercial loans, the decline was marked by the behavior of both those granted against documents payable to bearer as well as current account advances, the latter showing a change in its behavior compared to what was observed in the previous month.

## Liquidity

 The increase in deposits together with the cancellation of loans were the main sources of funds for financial entities during October. The principal use of these resources turned out to be the increase in the current accounts of entities at the Central Bank.

 The system liquidity indicator defined as the ratio between bank reserves – excluding the technical reserve requirement – and deposits, in October reached around 16%. As can be observed in the following chart, this ratio has increased significantly in recent months, presenting an increase of 6 percentage points since June. Likewise, the chart shows the evolution of the indicator since 1994. There a comparison can be made with what happened in the so-called "Tequila" crisis of early 1995. In both situations similar minimum ratios were observed, with the current ratio equivalent to that which was verified in June 1996, with the crisis fully overcome and in full application of the schedule for increasing reserve requirements.

 The comparison of the distribution of this indicator for the months of June and October allows us to observe how the increase in liquidity has been distributed. In June, 23 entities that represented just under 60% of the system's deposits had a current account balance that was equivalent to less than 5% of their deposits, while in October only 6 entities representing 15% of deposits showed those relatively lower levels.

On the other hand, the analysis of the evolution of the position of reserve requirements (minimum cash and resource application) by entity shows that over the last few months there has been a shift toward less deficit positions (or more surplus positions). While in July there were 41 entities with deficit positions representing 77% of the requirement, in October there were 24 representing 56% of the requirement.

## Monetary Base and Creation Factors

In October, the monetary base grew $1,800 million (8%) fundamentally due to the 20% increase in current account deposits of entities in the BCRA (approximately $1,500 million), while monetary circulation increased by around $300 million (2%).

8 Monetary Report October 2002

After two months of nominal decreases, currency in the hands of the public showed a slight increase in October. However, in real terms, bills and coins practically showed no differences with respect to the previous month. In this sense, it should be recalled that in the first quarter of the year, as a consequence of restrictions in the financial system, the holding of bills and coins in real terms (considering quasi-money) had increased significantly. Starting in April, with the gradual restoration of the functioning of the payment system, a decline in this component of money demand began to be verified, toward its historical values.

The purchase of foreign currency from the private sector constituted once again the main factor of expansion of the monetary base. For its part, operations with the National Government were the second cause of variation. As for Central Bank Letters (Lebacs), which will be dealt with in a separate section, acted as an absorption factor.

A fact to highlight in the month is that the liquidity observed in the system, already mentioned in previous paragraphs, led to the fact that for the first time in the year there has been no type of assistance to entities on the part of the Central Bank.

## International Reserves
In October 2002, the BCRA intervened in the foreign exchange market by making net purchases of foreign currency of US$480 million – the highest monthly purchase level since the recovery began. In this way, the BCRA continued with the policy of reconstituting its stock of international reserves, which after having observed a minimum of US$ 8,800 million in mid-August, reached US$ 9,880 million by the end of October, accumulating growth of 5% during this last month. This growth in the BCRA's international reserves occurred while the price of the US dollar showed a decline in the foreign exchange market. The dollar price fell from $3.75 at the end of September to $3.55 on the last day of October. The futures dollar, in part a reflection of the market's devaluation expectations, showed levels consistent with the decline observed in the spot market.

10 Monetary Report October 2002

Although the decrease in the exchange rate managed to make alternative investments more attractive, financial entities increased their position in foreign currency during the observed period. From the end of September to the end of October, the general position of changes (PGC) grew, concluding the month around 51% of the maximum permitted limit – 5% of the RPC of November 2001.

Among those that most increased their PGC are domestic private banks, which went from 59% to 81% of their maximum permitted and approaching almost the 100% recorded in public banks. The branches of foreign entities, which for their part started from the lowest level, 8% of the maximum permitted, showed an increase close to 11 percentage points. Conversely, private entities with foreign majority shareholding opted for a selling position and ended the month at the lowest recorded level (16%).

Given the increase in the PGC, mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, and the limit required by regulation, it is evident the decrease in the capacity of entities to increase their future PGC.

**LEBACs**

During the month of October, the interest rates paid by LEBAC placements continued the downward trend of recent months for all maturities, while a significant increase was verified in the average duration of the total portfolio in circulation. The trajectory of LEBAC rates contributed to the decline in interest rates in the domestic money market, including passive interest rates and those operated in the interbank market.

Although the total average cost remained at the level of late September, at the end of October it corresponded to a portfolio in circulation with a significantly longer average life than the one in effect at that time. The average duration of the LEBACs portfolio in circulation in pesos went from 14 days at the end of September to 41 days on October 31, which was possible from the placement of letters in pesos with a 182-day term and through the continuation of the issuance of letters at 56 and 84 days. For its part, the average life of LEBACs in dollars in circulation also showed a slight improvement, going from 6 to 10 days due to the allocation of letters in dollars with a 28-day term. Likewise, this made it possible to construct a short-term yield curve with a positive slope for the only securities currently issued by the Public Sector. On the other hand, it is worth noting that the best placement conditions were achieved by increasing the total amount in circulation of LEBACs. At the end of October, the outstanding stock of this type of securities in pesos was VN $2,678 million (VN $886 million or 33% more than on September 30), while the one corresponding to LEBACs in dollars was VN US$ 182 million (23% decline in VN with respect to September 30). This increase meant a contractionary monetary effect of $492 million for the month of October.

As mentioned above, domestic interest rates aligned with the trend followed by the rates resulting from LEBAC auctions. As a consequence, the rates paid for fixed terms in pesos of 30 days and between 7 and 59 days decreased 13 and 15 percentage points respectively, while the average rate in the interbank market for operations in pesos up to 15 days decreased by 14 percentage points.
