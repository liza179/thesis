this regard, the greatest contraction was generated by the cancellation of

 (see Graph 2.1). The average BMA decreased $1,047 million
54 (1.9%), accumulating a decline so far this year of 3.5% in real

52 terms. With respect to its components, while bank reserves fell in
 September $1,477 million (8.6%), currency in circulation increased

 The collection of rediscounts that had been granted during
46 the 2001 crisis was the main factor of contraction of the BMA in
Dec-04 Feb-05 Apr-05 Jun-05 Aug-05 Oct-05 Dec-05 the month, due to several financial institutions deciding to cancel
Source: BCRA their debts with the BCRA in advance. Recall that since the BCRA

 implemented, at the beginning of the year, the mechanism for
 early redemption of rediscounts, this contraction factor has grown in
 importance. Thus, through this concept and the usual payment of the
 monthly "matching" installment, the BMA fell in September $2,364
 million.

 by the BCRA, this segment went from constituting only 3% of
 placements in August to making up 18% in September, with yields
 between 8% and 10%, depending on maturity. On the other hand, in
 September only one NOBAC placement was carried out, with a coupon
 variable according to the BADLAR interest rate reported by private
 sector financial institutions, which paid an interest rate of 8.44%,
 0.1 p.p. below the last one awarded last month.
The total amount in circulation of LEBAC and NOBAC3 increased 9% between the end of August and September, and reached at the end of this latter month a level of VN $26,965 million. The monthly increase was concentrated mainly in 3-month LEBAC, where only 4% of the offers received were rejected. In this segment together with the 1-month residual term LEBAC segment, the amounts offered by investors were concentrated. However, with the exception of 9-month LEBAC, for all the rest of the species auctioned, it was also observed that the amounts offered by financial entities exceeded those announced in the various auctions by the BCRA (see Graph 3.1.2). As of September 30, the total stock in circulation was composed of 65% by LEBAC and NOBAC in pesos not adjustable by CER, while the remainder were almost entirely securities with capital adjustable by the aforementioned index.

**3.2.1. Repo Market**

The BCRA maintained its short-term reference interest rates, thus continuing to receive funds at 1 day and paying 3.75% for it, while it continued to arrange passive and active repos at 7 days at 4.25% and 5.25% respectively. Including operations arranged between third parties, the average monthly total interest rate for 7 days remained at 4.3%, while that for 1 day increased 0.2 p.p. and was placed at 3.8%.

The average daily amount traded by the BCRA in the REPO session was $2,336 million, barely 2% lower than that recorded in August. Likewise, the amounts traded between third parties (without Central Bank intervention) also remained at levels similar to those of the previous month, at around $300 million daily (see Graph 3.2.1.1).

On the other hand, within the framework of Communication A 4399, some entities also arranged repos with the BCRA, placing the excess liquidity amounts at the end of each day. For this concept, $126 million was traded daily on average.

If the operations carried out by investment funds are incorporated into the aforementioned operations, the balance at the end of September of passive repos for the BCRA was $7,226 million, while the active repos for this entity was $59 million.

The interest rates in the interbank market continued during September at the levels reached in June, fluctuating around the short-term reference interest rates established by the BCRA through its repo operations (see Graph 3.2.2.1).

In the 1 business day segment (which currently represents approximately 70% of the financing stock) interest rates were located at 4.5% n.a. on average. In the 7-day term segment, interest rates were located at 5.2% n.a. on average and approximately 80% of operations in this segment were conducted within the interest rate corridor established by the BCRA (4.25%-5.25%).

3.3. Passive Interest Rates

During September, passive interest rates remained stable at August levels. However, increases were observed in placements at longer terms. The average interest rate in September in the 30 to 59-day bracket was 4.1% annual rate and was 5% annual rate for placements of 60 to 89 days, both rates showing an increase of 0.05 percentage points with respect to the previous month. While the rate for fixed-term deposits of more than 90 days increased 0.15 percentage points with an average of 5.4% annual rate. In this latter term bracket, the main increases were recorded in placements of the corporate sector and in financial services providing institutions (AFJP, FCI, insurance companies, etc.). For the first sector, the average interest rate was 6.35%, with a monthly increase of 0.6 percentage points and for financial services providing institutions the interest rate was 7.1% and increased 0.45 percentage points. On the other hand, deposit rates of the public sector declined slightly at all terms and interest rates on placements of individuals showed no changes.

If we observe the total average passive interest rate in September, it was 4.3% annual rate, maintaining a stable level for the last three months and following the evolution of the BCRA reference interest rates in the repurchase agreement market (See Chart 3.3.1).

By bank type, in the 30-44 day bracket, interest rates for deposits less than $100,000 in private banks remained stable during most of the month presenting an average of 4.2% annual rate and in the last days of September they increased 0.1 percentage points. In placements greater than $1 million, the interest rate increased in the first days of September and the average

 The decline in funds deposited on sight partially
 compensated for the increase in currency in the hands of the public,
 resulting in an increase in means of payment (M2) close to $250
 million. In relation to September of last year, this aggregate grew
 21.2%, which in real terms is equivalent to an annual variation of

 the broadest monetary aggregate (M3) of around $1,630 million.
 In annual terms, this aggregate grew 20.8%, which represents a

 applying reserve coefficients on foreign currency obligations is computed, without considering the increase in the same equivalent to the
 failure to apply resources.

 or foreign entities. In this way, among the possible destinations
 to which the surplus of liquidity in foreign currency can be applied
 are the financing of exports, financial trusts whose underlying assets
 are loans linked to export financing, loans to producers of final or
 intermediate goods that have guarantees from exporters and debt
 securities or participation certificates in trusts whose underlying
 assets are comprised of documents purchased by the trustee for the
 purpose of financing operations linked to foreign trade.

 in year-on-year terms. As has been observed recently, said
 growth was generalized across all lending lines, from
 current account advances, very short-term, to

 Likewise, the excellent situation that the
 automotive sector is going through allowed
 financing with pledge guarantee to continue growing (see Chart 5.3), and registered in
 September an increase of $90 million (4.5%).

 In the case of mortgage loans, for the fourth consecutive month
 new financing exceeded in amount the
 amortizations and prepayments for which they showed an
 increase, on this occasion exceeding $50 million (see
 Chart 5.4).

 6 The loan figures are adjusted for accounting movements, fundamentally caused by transfers of
 credits in portfolio of entities to financial trusts.

 6.1. Foreign Exchange Market

 International reserves increased by US$362 million
 between the end of August and September and reached on September 30
 US$25,614 million (see Chart 6.1.1). The payments made by the
 public sector to international organizations caused a monthly
 fall in foreign currency of US$770 million, while the purchase of
 foreign currency carried out by the BCRA in the Sole and Free
 Exchange Market generated an increase in reserves of approximately
 US$1,000 million. The rest of the increase came from the rise in
 bank reserves in dollars and the positive return obtained from
 international reserves of the BCRA.

 Spot exchange market operations agreed
 through the Electronic Operations System averaged
 US$175 million daily, a level similar to those traded in July and August.
 However, the composition of the counterparties changed

 In the secondary market of corporate debt instruments, greater
 differentiation continues to be observed between companies that
 complied with their financial obligations and those that had to resort
 to debt restructuring after falling into default following the 2001-02
