## SUMMARY

• The average level of means of payment (M2) decreased $950 million in August and was positioned at $111,932 million, showing a trajectory in line with that forecast in the 2006 Monetary Program. Thus, M2 continues showing a marked deceleration in its year-over-year growth rate that fell from 24.8% at the end of last year to 19.9% this month.

• The monthly decrease in M2 was explained mainly by the reduction in sight deposits, both public and private. The fall in sight deposits of the private sector responded mainly to funds that were deposited in savings accounts and were transferred to time deposits. The fall in public sight deposits responded partly to transfers to time deposits and partly to internal payments (BODEN to banks and cancellation of BCRA advances).

• For its part, time deposits showed strong growth during August, which totaled $3,300 million and extended to both public and private placements. In this behavior, the regulatory changes that the BCRA has been implementing would be influencing, with the objective of encouraging the lengthening of the term of financing of financial entities and stimulating savings. In this sense, in August a modification in reserve requirement coefficients came into effect that raised the requirement for sight deposits from 17% to 19% and eliminated the corresponding one for time placements greater than 180 days. The impact of the measure is estimated at $1,700 million.

• Loans to the private sector in pesos continued with their sustained growth rate and increased $1,420 million (2.6%). In year-over-year terms, they accumulate a nominal increase of 39.1% and 25.6% in real terms. Growth was observed in all credit lines, from short-term advances to long-term mortgage loans, although during the month there was increasing dynamism in the longer-term lines and certain deceleration in the shorter-term ones. It is to be expected that this will be accentuated in the coming months, within the framework of the measures adopted to promote the increase in long-term credit and facilitate access to new mortgage financing for single-family housing and permanent occupation.

• The interest rates of the interbank market decreased during August, while the volumes traded were reduced. Interest rates moved in the same direction for the shortest-term active rates. In contrast, among passive interest rates, that of wholesale placements showed slight increases at the beginning of the month and then stabilized. Meanwhile, rates for retail deposits remained stable.

• The BCRA continued with its prudential policy of accumulation of international reserves, and these reached US$27,397 million at the end of August. In addition to the measure of increasing reserve requirements, sterilization was carried out through the placement of LEBAC and NOBAC in the market. The public sector (which canceled temporary advances with the BCRA with resources deposited in the local financial system), passive repo operations and cancellations of rediscounts within the "matching" scheme were also factors of monetary contraction.

2 It should be mentioned that in August 2005 the CNV regulation came into effect: by which the deposits that constitute the minimum liquidity margin of money market funds went from being deposited in savings accounts in the financial system to being deposited in accounts opened in the BCRA. For this reason, the calculation of the year-over-year variation in sight deposits should be corrected for this effect.

Source: BCRA
The bank liquidity ratio increased in August as financial institutions raised the balances in their current accounts at the BCRA, while keeping the repos arranged with this Institution practically unchanged. Thus, the bank liquidity ratio increased approximately 1 percentage point of total deposits in pesos, from 17% to 18% (see Graph 3.1).

20 Thus, the month of August was characterized by an ample liquidity situation in the system, which came not only from

18 the growth evidenced in deposits but also from the collection of

16 BODEN that institutions received at the beginning of the month, both in pesos and dollars (part of those dollars were sold in the market). In August, the modifications to the reserve requirement policy introduced by the BCRA came into effect. In this regard, the coefficients of reserve requirements on sight deposits were raised from 17% to 19% and from 8% to 10% the coefficients on deposits made by court order. Likewise, the requirement on placements with terms longer than 180 days was eliminated. This modification in the reserve requirement coefficients aims to favor the extension of the average term of placements by incentivizing migration from sight accounts to term deposits.

The volatility of Argentina's returns was reduced in
line with the evolution of volatility in emerging and
developed markets (see Graph 7.3). In particular, this variable
decreased to the levels of the first quarter in the case of both
Bovespa, the IPC and the Merval, as well as in the case of the
S&P 500 of the U.S. In the case of the Merval, the decrease was
significant, dropping from 25% at the end of July, to the 16%
registered at the end of August.

The investment portfolio of the Pension and Retirement Fund Administrators (AFJP) totaled $76,260 million as of August 15. In the year-over-year comparison, AFJP assets showed an increase of 12.2% in real terms.

When comparing with data from July 15, there is an increase in the portfolio of $2,622 million. The monthly variation in the portfolio is explained fundamentally by the increase in the value of public securities holdings ($1,946 million). There were also increases in futures and options ($465 million), and in securities issued by state entities ($295 million), in the value of holdings of Investment Fund shares (FCI) ($141 million) and Negotiable Obligations (ONs) ($113 million). On the downside, there is a notable decrease in fixed-term deposits ($496 million) and in available funds ($118 million).
