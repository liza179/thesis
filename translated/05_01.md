Monthly Monetary Report

JANUARY 2005

## CONTENTS

1. Summary 1

1. Summary 1
   - The BMA fell $3,120 million throughout January and ended the month at $49,500 million. If average figures are considered, which include the "carryover" from the previous month, the BMA level was placed at $50,200 million, in line with what was foreseen in the 2005 Monetary Program.

2. Monetary Program 2
   - The BCRA arranged a new reduction in reserve requirement coefficients in a context of progressive normalization of the financial system and in order to promote credit expansion.

3. Interest Rates 2
   - In the repo market, the BCRA continued operating in the 7-day segment and arranged an increase of 0.25 percentage points in interest rates. In this way, it began to arrange reverse repos at 2.75% and repos at 3.25%, with the objective of setting a short-term interest rate corridor. In the 1-day segment, the interest rate increased slightly compared to the previous month's level (2.19%). In the call market, 70% of the operations arranged in the 7-day segment were conducted at interest rates within the corridor established by the BCRA through its repo operations.

3.1. Securities Issued by the BCRA 3
   - Passive interest rates continued with their downward trend, while active interest rates showed no significant variations during January.

3.2. Interbank Markets 3
   - Monetary aggregates continued to grow, with M2 recording an increase of 1.7% and M3 an increase of 2.2%, driven on average by private sector deposits. When comparing end-of-month balances, a homogeneous growth is observed in both public and private sector placements, as well as a sharp contraction in currency in circulation held by the public of a seasonal nature. In terms of structure, the majority of the increase was concentrated in time deposits.

3.2.1 Repo Market 3
   - Loans to the private sector in pesos showed an increase of approximately $1,230 million between end of month figures. On average, the increase was smaller and reached $300 million (0.9%), as a consequence of the carryover from the previous month that affected the variation of commercial lines. For its part, credit associated with consumption continued to show great dynamism and loans with real guarantees remained relatively stable.

3.2.2 Interbank Market 4
   - The BCRA's international reserves exceeded US$20,100 million at the end of January, reaching the highest level since October 2001. The monthly increase was 2.5% and the year-on-year growth was 35%. The BCRA purchased $320 million in the market, 60% less than in the same month of the previous year.

3.3. Passive Interest Rates 4
   - In nominal terms, the peso appreciated 0.9% and 3.2% in relation to the US dollar and the euro respectively, and showed no changes with respect to the Brazilian real, while in real terms, it presented an appreciation of 2.4% with respect to the basket of currencies of the main trading partners. However, in the last twelve months it accumulated a real depreciation of 3.3%.

Monthly Monetary Report – JANUARY 2005

2. Monetary Program
# The BMA fell $3,120 million between the end of December and the end of January, reaching a level of $49,500 million. Of the aforementioned fall, $1,890 million had its origin in the seasonal behavior of currency in circulation, while $1,230 million responded to the decrease in bank reserves.

On the other hand, considering monthly average figures, the level of the BMA was positioned at $50,200 million and showed a year-on-year variation of 6.6%. The value reached on average by this variable was in line with the behavior anticipated in the 2005 Monetary Program. The decrease observed in the month was decomposed into a reduction of $1,380 million in bank reserves in pesos and an increase of $940 million (2.9%) in currency in circulation held by the public, a consequence of the "carryover" effect on its average balance of the increase that occurred in December.

In January, through operations in the repo market, a contraction of the BMA of $3,200 million occurred, although considering average figures, the absorption for this item was $2,080 million (see Chart 2.1).

The rest of the operations of the financial sector implied a decrease of the BMA of $160 million, which was the counterpart of the cancellation of the monthly installment provided for in the scheme known as matching. In this regard, and in its effort to diversify monetary regulation instruments, the BCRA implemented the first auction that allows advancing the cancellation of rediscounts granted. Although this auction was held on January 20, its contractionary effect on the monetary base will materialize in the first days of February.

The scenario of abundant liquidity that characterized the banking system had an impact on an increase in the net placement of LEBAC and NOBAC, which generated a decrease of approximately $670 million of the BMA ($650 million considering the monthly flow).

In line with the seasonal behavior of peso demand, the BCRA decreased its intervention in the foreign exchange market with respect to December, accumulating net foreign currency purchases of $930 million (equivalent to US$320 million) throughout the month, a figure almost 60% lower than that corresponding to the same month of the previous year. When explaining the variation of the average BMA of January with respect to the average of December, the external sector contributes $2,470 million due to the carryover effect from the previous month.

## 3. Interest Rates

Regarding monetary policy, the most important measures taken by the BCRA in January were the reduction in reserve coefficients, the increase in interest rates for repo operations and the auction for the early cancellation of rediscounts. The funds released by the first measure together with those from deposits were largely applied to the repo market with the BCRA, to the primary market of LEBAC and NOBAC, and to a lesser extent, given the low commercial activity characteristic of the month, to the loan market. The increase in net placement of securities issued by the BCRA determined a fall in their interest rates. The amount traded in the interbank loan market also decreased and passive interest rates accentuated the downward trend they had been showing.
0.0 Finally, active interest rates showed no significant variations in relation to the previous month.

The interest rates resulting from the last auction of BCRA securities in January were slightly lower than those paid at the end of December. For LEBAC in pesos non-adjustable by CER with maturities up to 6 months, a decrease of around 0.3 p.p. was observed, while the interest rate for NOBAC in pesos adjustable by CER with 4 years maturity decreased 0.2 p.p. (see Chart 3.2.1.1 Chart 3.1.1). The implicit inflation in the margin between the interest rates of LEBAC in pesos non-adjustable by CER and those adjustable by CER for 12 months remained at 6%, 1.3 p.p. below the REM forecasts for this variable.

3.5 Regarding the stock of BCRA securities (LEBAC and NOBAC), the greater liquidity of financial entities resulted in a substantial increase in their net placement, which was the highest of the last 12 months (see Chart 3.1.2). Thus, the total amount in circulation of securities amounted to VN $15,540 million at the end of January and its composition was similar to that at the end of 2004. In this way, 52% consisted of LEBAC and NOBAC in pesos non-adjustable by CER, 47% by securities in pesos adjustable by CER, and the remaining 1% by LEBAC in dollars.

 In fact, while the average stock of current account deposits
 decreased $340 million, end-of-month balances increased $110 million.
 In the case of savings account funds, both variations were positive,
 being on the order of $40 million.
Cash in circulation in the hands of the public, for its part, showed an increase of $940 million. As in the case of deposits, the average variation of this aggregate was strongly influenced by the increase from the previous month. However, when analyzing the data between end-of-month figures, a decline of $1,890 million is noted, which partially offset the December increase.

**Graph 4.1.2
Monetary Aggregates in Pesos
% (Year-on-year Variation)**

As a consequence of the increase in cash in circulation in the hands of the public and in demand deposits, M2 presented an average increase of $1,390 million (1.7%), which in year-on-year terms represents a rise of 31.6% (see Graph 4.1.2). Meanwhile, between end-of-month figures, due to the contraction of cash in circulation, total means of payment showed a decline of $1,500 million.

As typically occurs in January, fixed-term deposits presented a significant increase that amounted to $1,820 million, driven by placements from the private sector. If end-of-month figures are considered, the increase was even greater and amounted to $2,810 million, which were distributed evenly between placements from the private sector ($1,430 million) and the public sector ($1,380 million). Returning to the analysis of average figures, the latter were most affected by the carry-over from the previous month, given that a large portion of the funds used by ANSES for the payment of salary expenses was deposited on a fixed-term basis. Although the withdrawal of these resources in December was compensated in January by the fixing of term deposits from AFIP and fiduciary funds, concentrated in the over 90-day segment, the average stock of fixed-term deposits in the public sector increased by only $150 million. In the case of private sector deposits, which increased $1,670 million on average, a large part of the growth took place in the wholesale segment ($1,100 million), although significant growth was also observed in fixed-term deposits under $1 million, which since May of the previous year had been showing a slightly negative trend (see Graph 4.1.3). As for maturity structure, although positive variations were recorded in all segments, most of the new placements materialized at over 90 days, generating an increase of $1,170 million in the stock of these fixed-term deposits. A large portion of these funds were placed in CER-adjusted deposits, attracted by expectations of higher relative returns given the inflation levels observed in December and January.

**Graph 4.1.3
Private Sector Fixed-Term Deposits in Pesos
(monthly average balance) thousands of millions of $**

The increase in fixed-term placements was partially offset by the decline of $160 million in the stock of CER-adjusted CEDRO, which resulted in an increase of $1,660 million in fixed-term deposits. The increase in these placements, partially offset by the decline of $140 million in other deposits and added to the increase of $1,390 million in means of payment, resulted in the growth of $2,910 million (2.2%) of the broadest monetary aggregate (M3), which in year-on-year terms implied a variation of around 22.3%. Between end-of-month figures, this aggregate also grew, thanks to the strong increase in fixed-term deposits, and showed an increase close to $1,300 million.

Private sector loans in pesos showed between
At the end of the month an increase of around $1,230 million, although on average the increase was smaller and reached $300 million (0.9%),

as a consequence of the carryover from the previous month that affected the variation of commercial lines. In effect, when comparing the end-of-month balances of said lines a significant growth is observed, which compensated for the decline evidenced in December. For their part, credits associated with consumption continued showing great dynamism and loans with real guarantees remained relatively stable (see Graph 5.1).

Commercial loans grew between end-of-month around $680 million. However, on average the variation was negative, around $160 million (-0.9%) as a consequence of the fall of $210 million in the stock of advances in current account and the decrease of $50 million in other loans, which were partially compensated by the increase of $100 million in documented credits. It should be noted that the variation registered by advances in current account contains an important carryover component from the previous month. As a consequence of the higher liquidity levels presented by companies, thanks to higher end-of-year sales and their cash surpluses resulting from the postponement of income tax payment, the stock of advances in current account had decreased considerably in the last days of December, ending the year at relatively low levels. This negatively influenced the average evolution of said credits, whose stock was being rebuilt throughout January until ending at levels similar to those of early December, presenting an increase between end-of-month of around $830 million. In the case of financings implemented through documents, their lower growth was associated with the lower level of commercial activity that characterizes the summer period. The operations most affected by this seasonal phenomenon were the purchase and discount of documents, which presented variations considerably lower than those of previous months, on the order of $3 million and $80 million respectively.

Credits associated with consumption accumulated in January an increase close to $360 million, which on average exceeded $450 million (6.2%), driven mainly by personal loans that continue showing a firm growth rate.

³ The loan figures are adjusted for accounting movements, fundamentally caused by transfers of financial trusts, which while affecting the balances of this balance sheet item do not affect the stock of financing granted. In turn, in November a correction of the personal loans series was made, as a public entity incorporated financing that until that moment was not reporting.

In effect, these lines registered an average increase of $300 million, while credit card financings increased on average $150 million. The good performance of the latter is linked, on one hand, with the validity of consumption promotions in interest-free installments and, on the other hand, with the seasonality inherent to the month associated with summer vacations (see Graph 5.2).

Given that January is a seasonally inactive month in the automotive market and in the agricultural sector, the lower growth evidenced by chattel mortgage lines was foreseeable. When comparing the

 The equity of mutual investment funds in pesos reached $6,000 million in January, to register a monthly increase of 7% ($390 million), explained mainly by fixed-term and money market funds (see Chart 6.2.3.2.1). In terms of returns, fixed income funds and money market funds continued showing positive results, while the rest showed negative results (see Chart 6.2.3.2.2).

 Money market funds grew $270 million during January, reaching $3,900 million, which represents a monthly variation of around 7%. As in previous months, seasonal intramonthly movements were observed during January. Until mid-month and as a consequence of income from commercial activity, of a seasonal nature, there was a growth of $690 million. Then, as a result of the tax payment outcome, it decreased by $420

Chart 6.2.3.2.1 million. For its part, the annualized return of these funds decreased slightly, reaching 2.3% in January.

 Equity of Mutual Investment Funds in Pesos Variable income funds presented in January a patrimonial increase of only $9 million and reached $1,400 million. This was mainly due to the inflow of new funds, given the fall in the value of their share units, whose evolution is found

 For its part, fixed income funds had significant
 growth, registering an increase of $100 million and reaching

 increase is explained mainly by the influx of new funds,
 mostly institutional and corporate funds, given that the value of
 their share prices increased only 0.8%, associated with the improvement in the
 quotation of public securities in portfolio. The latter also had an impact
