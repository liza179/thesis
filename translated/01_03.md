# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information
Communication No. 39,876

## Monetary Situation (February 2001)

In February, deposits significantly reduced their growth rate. Considering average figures, the month's growth was $350 million (0.4%), and it originated entirely from the behavior of private deposits ($450 million), as public sector deposits fell slightly. Among private deposits, time deposits increased by approximately $300 million.

However, much of the described behavior was due to the "carryover" effect from January, since throughout February deposits maintained practically their level (not considering intra-monthly seasonality), although with a change in their composition, in favor of savings account deposits. The increase in savings accounts throughout February would be associated with the growth of mutual investment funds that invest in time deposits and must maintain a proportion in checking accounts.

Obeying seasonal behavior, monetary circulation fell $400 million (3%) relative to the January average. This evolution, together with that of deposits, determined that broad monetary resources (M3*) remained at the previous month's level.

Loans granted by the financial system, whether to the private or public sector, showed declines.

In February, an increase in the surplus position of liquidity requirements was verified. The integration increased almost US$500 million, somewhat above the increase in the requirement, as a result of the increase in deposits, changes in their composition toward those with higher requirement (mutual fund checking account deposits), and the application of the increase schedule for some liabilities of the entities.

In this context, the average level of international reserves of the financial system increased US$100 million relative to the January average.

The greater liquidity of the entities determined a decrease in domestic interest rates throughout the month, whose magnitude depended on the type of operation. Interest rates on interbank loans fell 0.5 percentage points, and those on fixed terms of more than one million pesos (or dollars), almost 1 percentage point. If we consider monthly average figures, the decline was around 2 percentage points. In a context of increased country risk, the decline in interest rates is an indicator of the abundant liquidity of the entities during February.

## Private Banks (data as of December 2000)

During December 2000, the total assets of the private banks group registered a decline of 1.5%, due mainly to the decrease of 4.3% in the item "Other credits from financial intermediation" and the fall in total loans (1.7%). The behavior of the first item was strongly associated with the decrease in forward operations (13.3%), which was slightly offset by the increase in the integration of liquidity requirements with deposit certificates (15.3%) that are recorded in this item. The decline in total assets was attenuated by the increase in available funds of 14.6%, also due to the greater integration for liquidity requirements. As for alternative funding sources, negotiable obligations registered a decline of 7.0%, while loan lines from abroad increased 22.6% due to the behavior of an important private bank.
# MONTHLY REPORT - CENTRAL BANK OF ARGENTINA

Private banks recorded profits equivalent to 7.7% of net equity on an annualized basis. The slight increase in profitability compared to the previous month was due particularly to the combination of two effects, one positive: the increase in interest income results and the decrease in loan loss provisions; and one negative: the increase in administrative expenses due to seasonal factors. Although accumulated benefits for the year 2000 amount to only 0.8% of net equity on an annualized basis, a figure much lower than the 2.3% recorded during 1999, this effect is due, as has been mentioned on various occasions, to the action of an important private bank that charged high loan loss provisions in March 2000. Finally, if we exclude this bank from the analysis, the accumulated profitability for 2000 was 5.9%. Thus, the profit for 2000 was higher than that recorded in 1999, due especially to the decline in administrative expenses and loan loss provisions, partially offset by an annual decrease in interest income results.

Due to modifications in the Monthly Reporting Regime, portfolio quality information is not available at this date.

The total capital requirement of private banks recorded a slight increase of 0.9% in December, explained almost entirely by the increase in capital requirement for credit risk (1.1%). On the other hand, total capital integration decreased 1.0% in December 2000, due to the decline in basic and supplementary net equity and the increase in deductible accounts. The variations in total capital requirement and integration caused a decrease in the integration surplus, which in terms of total capital requirement went from 50.1% to 47.3%. Finally, capital integration in terms of risk-weighted assets according to Basel fell 0.4 percentage points, standing at a level (19.7%) much higher than that established by local regulation and by international minimum standards.
