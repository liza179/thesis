The monthly inflation rate fell in September to a level similar to the monthly performance of the monetary policy rate (6.2%). Core inflation was even lower (5.5%). In this context, the BCRA kept its reference interest rates and the minimum guaranteed rate for fixed-term deposits unchanged, following nine consecutive monthly increases.

The broad monetary aggregate (M3 private) would have registered a slight monthly expansion at constant prices (1.1% s.e.), although with heterogeneous behavior at the component level. While means of payment continued to contract, deposits continued to grow and gain relative participation. In fact, these surpassed transactional sight deposits, a situation that had not occurred in the last 20 years.

Within the savings instruments in pesos, fixed-term placements stood out, whose monthly expansion in real terms would have been greater than 5% s.e. In this way, the balances of fixed-term deposits in pesos of the private sector at constant prices would have marked a new historical maximum and as a percentage of GDP would be located at a level similar to the maximum reached during the pandemic.

Finally, loans to the private sector at constant prices and without seasonality would have registered a monthly contraction, accumulating four consecutive months of declines, with generalized behavior across the major lines of lending.

## 2. Means of Payment
Means of payment (M2 private transactional¹), at constant prices and adjusted for seasonality (s.e.) would have registered in October a contraction of 2.2%, a rate slightly lower than that of the previous month. Thus, they accumulated 9 consecutive months of negative variations (see Graph 2.1). The dynamics of the month responded both to the behavior of currency in circulation and of non-remunerated sight deposits. In the year-on-year comparison, and at constant prices, private transactional M2 would be located around 18.4% below the level of October 2021. In terms of Product it would have been located at 8%, exhibiting a decrease (0.2 p.p.) compared to last month (see Graph 2.2). Both components of means of payment remain in terms of GDP around the lows of the last 20 years and, in the case of currency in circulation, a new low was marked.

## 3. Savings Instruments in Pesos

The low dynamism of demand for means of payment was explained by a greater preference of agents for remunerated savings instruments. Thus, in October, fixed-term deposits in pesos of the private sector at constant prices would have marked a new positive monthly variation, this time of 5.3% s.e. In this way, the balance of fixed-term deposits reached, at constant prices, a new historical maximum. As a ratio of GDP these placements would have registered an increase compared to September (0.4 p.p.) and would reach a level of 7.5%, a record similar to the maximum reached during the pandemic and one of the highest of recent years.

It should be noted that, after 9 consecutive monthly increases and the inflation rate descended to a level similar to the monthly yield of the monetary policy rate (6.2%), the Board of Directors of the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (BCRA) decided to keep the minimum guaranteed interest rates of fixed-term deposits unchanged in October². The decision was made considering the moderation in the pace of price growth in September, especially the Core CPI indicator (5.5%). In this way, the minimum guaranteed rate for placements of natural persons for amounts up to $10 million is maintained at

375% n.a. (107.05% e.a.), while for the rest of depositors of the financial system³ the interest rate is 66.5% n.a. (91.07% e.a.).
Analyzing the evolution of fixed-term deposits by amount stratum, although all segments contributed positively to the month's expansion, the most dynamic was that of $1 to $20 million (see Chart 3.1). Deposits of more than $20 million grew on average, although fundamentally due to the positive statistical carryover left by the previous month. In fact, if we consider the variation between end-of-month balances, a contraction is observed. This behavior was linked to growth in holdings of Financial Service Providers (FSP) that was lower than the month's inflation. In effect, the equity of Money Market Investment Funds (MMIF) decreased by 1.8% at constant prices, these being the main agents within FSPs. Something similar occurred with holdings of remunerated sight deposits of these institutional investors (see Chart 3.2). Investments with early cancellation options (which cannot be classified by type of holder) also explained the decline observed throughout the month in the wholesale segment. Finally, deposits of less than $1 million remained relatively stable once corrected for price evolution.

The segment of fixed-term deposits with CER adjustment presented a contraction in real terms for the third consecutive month. The decrease was verified both in traditional UVA placements and in pre-cancellable ones, whose monthly variation rates were located at -11.5% s.e. and -4.0% s.e. respectively (see Chart 3.3). Distinguishing by type of holder within instruments with CER adjustment, it is verified that the decline was explained fundamentally by lower holdings of individuals and, to a lesser extent, by the unwinding of positions of companies (excluding FSPs; see Chart 3.4). In any case, UVA deposits reached a balance of $367,053 million at month-end, which represented 5.2% of the total fixed-term instruments denominated in domestic currency.

On the other hand, deposits with adjustment based on the reference exchange rate value continued to show growing dynamics. It should be noted that the agricultural sector has two different types of deposits with exchange rate coverage available: a demand account, commonly known as "chacarero deposits" and fixed-term investments, called DIVA dollar. The first type of deposit registered a variation at the end of the month of 7.5% at current prices (1.4% real s.e.), reaching a balance of $116,000 million at the end of October. It should be noted that this increase was concentrated in the first days of the month as a result of the latest operations linked to the "Export Increase Program"4. For its part, DIVA dollars reached a balance of $42,700 million at the end of October, which implied an average monthly expansion of 9.4% at current prices in the tenth month of the year. To cover the exchange rate risk of these deposits, financial entities have available Letters with adjustment based on the dollar value (LEDIV).

In any case, the broad monetary aggregate, private M35, at constant prices and adjusted for seasonality, would have recorded in October a monthly expansion (1.1%). In year-on-year terms, this aggregate would have experienced a decline of 4.9%. As a percentage of GDP it would be positioned at 17.5%, 0.2 p.p. above the September figure.

## 4. Monetary Base

The Monetary Base on average in October was positioned at $4,225.1 billion, which implied a monthly increase of 1.1% ($45,232 million) in the original series at current prices. Adjusted for seasonality and at constant prices, it would have exhibited a contraction of 3.9% and in the last twelve months it would accumulate a decline of around 25%. As a ratio of GDP the Monetary Base would be positioned at 4.6%, a figure slightly lower than the previous month and the minimum value since 2003 (see Graph 4.1).

On the supply side, the average monthly expansion of the Monetary Base was explained fundamentally by the statistical carryover left by the foreign currency purchases carried out within the framework of the "Export Increase Program" during September. This effect was, on average for the month, partially compensated by the dynamics of monetary regulation instruments and public sector operations (see Graph 4.2).

In contrast, if we analyze the change at the end of the period of the Monetary Base by supply factors, we observe the opposite behavior. Net purchases of foreign currency had a slight contractionary effect, this was compensated by an expansion from the unwinding of remunerated liabilities of the BCRA. It should be noted that in mid-October the BCRA intervened again in the secondary market for Treasury instruments6. Nevertheless, the expansionary effect of these operations, on average, proved to be relatively limited (see Graph 4.3).

The BCRA maintained its reference interest rates unchanged in October, based on the decline observed in inflation. Thus, the interest rate on 28-day LELIQs continued to stand at 75% p.a. (107.35% e.a.), while the interest rate on 180-day LELIQs remained at 83.5% p.a. (101.23% e.a.). Regarding shorter-term instruments, the interest rate on 1-day reverse repos stands at 70% p.a. (101.24% e.a.); while the interest rate on 1-day repos is at 95% p.a. (158.25% e.a.). Finally, the fixed spread on NOTALIQs in the last auction of the month was set at 8.5 p.p.

6 Through communication "A" 7546, the mechanism for BCRA intervention in the secondary market for public securities was established.

 Monthly Monetary Report | October 2022 | BCRA | 6 With the current configuration of instruments, in October remunerated liabilities were composed, on average, of approximately 69% by 28-day LELIQs. The longer-term securities represented 13.6% of the total, concentrated practically entirely in NOTALIQs. For their part, 1-day reverse repos decreased their participation in the total of instruments, representing 16.2% of the total (1.5 p.p. less than the previous month). Finally, LEDIVs, together with LEGARs, concentrated the remaining 1.4%, with an increase of 0.6 p.p. with respect to September (see Chart 4.4).

5. Loans to the Private Sector

In October, loans in pesos to the private sector, measured in real terms and without seasonality, would have registered a monthly contraction of 3.5%, accumulating four consecutive months of decline. The decrease was widespread across major lines (see Chart 5.1). Thus, in the last twelve months credit would have accumulated a decline of 8.1% in real terms. The ratio between loans in pesos to the private sector and current GDP fell in the month (0.3 p.p.) and stood at 6.4% (see Chart 5.2).

 Monthly Monetary Report | October 2022 | BCRA | 7 When observing the evolution of loans by type of financing, lines with primarily commercial destination would have fallen 3.5% monthly s.e. in real terms. In the year-on-year comparison and at constant prices they would be positioned 2.8% below the October 2021 level. Within these financings, advances in current account would have fallen 3% s.e. in real terms (+2.3% y.o.y.). For their part, financing granted through documents would have shown a decrease at constant prices of 4.6% s.e. (-1.0% y.o.y.), explained both by the behavior of documents on signature (-3.1% monthly; +2.4% y.o.y.) and by discounted documents (-8.4% monthly; -3.0% y.o.y.).
The Productive Investment Financing Line (LFIP) continued to be the main tool used to channel productive credit to Micro, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs). At the end of October, the accumulated disbursements through the LFIP amounted to approximately $3,259 billion since its launch, with a nominal increase of 6.4% compared to the previous month (see Graph 5.3). By type of destination, approximately one-third of the financings granted through the LFIP correspond to investment projects and the rest to working capital.

Differentiating commercial loans by type of debtor, it is observed that in October credit to MSMEs in real terms would have expanded year-over-year at a rate of 7.5%, evidencing a deceleration at the margin. For its part, financing destined for large enterprises evidenced a contraction of 17.4% y.o.y. (see Graph 5.4).

Among consumption-related loans, financings implemented with credit cards would have evidenced a decrease in real terms of 4.2% s.e. in October, with the average balance positioning itself 12.3% below the level of a year ago. Meanwhile, personal loans would have exhibited a decline of 2.3% monthly at constant prices and would be 13.4% below the October 2021 level. The interest rate corresponding to personal loans averaged 82.9% n.a. (123% e.a.) in October, increasing 4.6 p.p. compared to the previous month.

With regard to lines with real guarantees, pledged loans would have registered a decrease in real terms of 3.1% s.e., although they would remain 15% above the registration of a year ago. For its part, the balance of mortgage credits would have shown in the month a decline of 4.3% s.e. at constant prices, accumulating a contraction of 25.0% in the last twelve months.

Monthly Monetary Report | October 2022 | BCRA | 86. Liquidity in pesos of financial entities

In October, broad banking liquidity in local currency showed an increase of 1.2 p.p. with respect to September, averaging 70.9% of deposits. Thus, it remained at historically elevated levels. This increase was driven mainly by remunerated liabilities of the BCRA (with increases in LELIQs that are not used to integrate minimum cash, partially offset by NOTALIQs and Net Repos).

In turn, there was a decline in integration with current accounts at the BCRA and LELIQs, partially offset by an increase in public securities (see Graph 6.1). In this regard, it should be noted that in October the simplification of the minimum cash regime ordered in June came into force. In this way, most of the LELIQs became to be considered as surpluses.

## 7. Foreign Currency

In the foreign currency segment, the main assets and liabilities of financial entities registered limited variations. On one hand, the balance of deposits from the private sector increased for a second consecutive month, averaging US$15,000 million, which implied a variation of approximately US$160 million. This increase was explained fundamentally by demand deposits of legal entities of more than US$1 million. On the other hand, the balance of loans to the private sector in foreign currency remained practically unchanged during the month (see Chart 7.1).

7 Includes current accounts at the BCRA, cash in banks, balances of net passes arranged with the BCRA, holdings of LELIQ and NOTALIQ and eligible public bonds to integrate reserve requirements.
8 Communication "A" 7536. A series of privileges were eliminated, preserving only those that favor productive credit to SMEs and consumer financing for households (Ahora12). With the intention of minimizing the monetary effect, a modification was made to the rates applied to minimum cash items. This latter will enter into force in the month of October, while the privilege associated with ATM withdrawals will be counted until the month of December inclusive.

The liquidity of financial entities in the foreign currency segment registered an increase of 0.4 percentage points with respect to the previous month, standing at 84.9% of October deposits. This increase was explained by an increase in cash in banks that was partially offset by a decline in the balance of current accounts in foreign currency (see Chart 7.2).
During October, a series of regulatory modifications took place regarding foreign exchange matters with which it was sought to allocate foreign currency more efficiently. On one hand, regulations linked to the refinancing and cancellation of capital maturity payments of liabilities in foreign currency were extended⁹, and on the other, conditions were established to provide access to the foreign exchange market to clients from various productive sectors¹⁰. Among the latter, the access to the foreign exchange market by companies that are beneficiaries of the foreign currency access regimes for incremental production of oil and/or natural gas stands out, to carry out debt capital payments, investment repatriations and profit and dividend payments¹¹. Finally, it was provided to tax with an additional withholding certain consumption in foreign currency that exceeds a certain amount¹², as well as some services (personal, cultural and recreational) contracted abroad¹³.

The BCRA's International Reserves ended October with a balance of US$ 38,676 million, reflecting an increase of US$ 1,051 million compared to the end of September. This increase was explained by the third disbursement from the International Monetary Fund carried out within the framework of the Extended Facilities Program (PFE). Said disbursement was for approximately US$ 3,900 million and was partially offset by: capital payments to said organization (approximately US$ 2,500 million) and by the net sale of foreign currency to the private sector (US$ 498 million; see Graph 7.3).

Finally, the bilateral nominal exchange rate (TCN) with respect to the US dollar increased 6.2% in October, an increase greater than that of the previous month (see Graph 7.4). In this way, it stood, on average, at $152.05/US$.

8. Regulatory Summary

Date of Emission Regulation Description

The regulations referred to the refinancing of capital maturity payments of liabilities in foreign
13-oct-22 Com. "A" 7621 currency were extended until December 31, 2023 and the requirement of prior compliance with the
BCRA for access to the foreign exchange market for the cancellation of capital services of financial
indebtedness with the exterior, when the creditor is a counterparty linked to the debtor.
Starting from October 17, 2022, it was established that entities may provide access to the foreign exchange market to carry out payments for imports of goods associated with a declaration in the Import System of the Argentine Republic (SIRA), insofar as certain conditions detailed in the regulation are met. Likewise, the access of financial entities to settle obligations derived from letters of credit or endorsed bills issued or granted from that date, within the framework of an import in which it is a requirement to have a declaration made through the Import System of the Argentine Republic (SIRA), is conditioned on the entity having documentation that demonstrates that certain requirements are met. For its part, it was established that the provisions in effect as of that date continue to govern access to the foreign exchange market to carry out payments for imports of goods for operations associated with a declaration in the Comprehensive Import Monitoring System (SIMI) made during its validity, or for operations for which the submission of a SIRA declaration is not required as a requirement for the registration of customs entry of goods.

On the other hand, it was permitted that entities may carry out exchange and arbitrage operations with their clients not associated with an inflow of foreign currency from abroad when it is transfers of foreign currency abroad of clients from their local accounts in foreign currency for payments of imports of goods for operations associated with a SIRA declaration insofar as the regulatory requirements established for that type of payment are met.

Finally, it was established that entities may grant access to the foreign exchange market to carry out payments for imports of goods for operations associated with a SIRA declaration before the deadline provided for in such declaration, insofar as certain conditions relative to the type of goods being imported, the origin and destination of the funds, or if the client has a "Certification of increase in exports of goods" for the amount for which it seeks to access.

It was established that the balances of financial entities in demand deposit accounts in foreign banks that originate exclusively from exchange operations of clients are not affected by the limits provided for in the regulations on "Large exposures to credit risk", insofar as certain requirements are met.

New goods were incorporated into the list of tariff positions of the Common Nomenclature of Mercosur (NCM) of pharmaceutical products and/or inputs used in their local elaboration, other goods related to health care or food for human consumption, covered by the provisions of Article 155 Tris of the Argentine Food Code.

In the first place, it was established that those who have a "Certification for the regimes of access to foreign currency for incremental production of oil and/or natural gas (Decree No. 277/22)" may access the foreign exchange market for up to the amount of the certification, insofar as certain requirements detailed in the regulations are met, for: 1) payments of principal on commercial debts for the import of goods and services; 2) payments of profits and dividends to non-resident shareholders; 3) payments of principal on financial borrowings from abroad whose creditor is a counterparty related to the debtor; 4) payments of principal on foreign currency financial debts above the amount resulting from the established parameters; 5) repatriations of direct investments of non-residents in companies that are not controlling entities of local financial entities.
In turn, it is established that the amounts of the "Certifications for the regimes of access to foreign currency for incremental production of oil and/or natural gas (Decree No. 277/22)" must be deducted from the amount of the "Certification of increase in exports of goods" that may be issued. Furthermore, clients may access the foreign exchange market to process capital payments of financial debts with abroad to the extent that certain requirements detailed in the regulations are met, referring to the origin of the debt, its average life, and that in the current calendar year access to the foreign exchange market has not occurred for an amount exceeding the equivalent of USD 20 million.

¹ The observed interest rate does not necessarily coincide with the minimum guaranteed interest rate because it includes deposits of up to $1 million from persons who, in total, in the financial entity exceed one million pesos.

The minimum guaranteed interest rate applies to all fixed-term deposits of a depositor insofar as the total fixed-term deposits in said entity do not exceed one million pesos.

² The Retail Reference Exchange Rate offered in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires is calculated considering the exchange rates bought and sold recorded by the adhering entities, weighted by their participation in the retail market. (Communication "B" 9791)
