Monetary Report | January 2011 | BCRA | 2

1. Summary
• Total means of payment (M2) reached an average balance of $269,800 million (32.2% y.o.y.), registering significant monthly growth driven by the positive statistical carryover from December, as a consequence of the high demand for transactional money characteristic of year-end. For its part, with an average balance of $228,280 million, the means of payment of the private sector (private M2) registered monthly growth of 3.5% (33.1% y.o.y.).

• The total of private deposits showed an increase of 2.3%, driven by both sight deposits (2.1%) and fixed-term deposits (3.4%). With respect to the latter, once the period of high liquidity demand concluded, they registered a monthly growth rate above that observed in October and November 2010. In particular, fixed-term deposits belonging to the wholesale tier (placements of more than $1 million) showed an increase of 3.7%, while those corresponding to the retail stratum (placements of less than $1 million) increased 3.1%.

• In the second month of the quarterly computation of the Minimum Cash position, financial institutions modified the composition of their peso liquidity. In particular, assets that are computed as integration of the Minimum Cash regime (cash and current accounts at the Central Bank) represented in January 16.1% of total peso deposits, a ratio 0.3 p.p. lower than the previous month. In turn, the holdings of LEBAC and NOBAC of the entities was reduced by the equivalent of 0.3 p.p. of deposits, while their repo position with the BCRA increased 0.7 p.p.. Thus the broad liquidity ratio (defined as the sum of cash in banks, the current account of entities at the BCRA, repos with the BCRA and holdings of LEBAC and NOBAC in terms of total peso deposits), was 40.7%, 0.1 p.p. higher than in December.

• Loans to the private sector in pesos grew 2.9% ($4,775 million), increasing their y.o.y. expansion rate to 37.9% y.o.y., 2.2 p.p. above December. Influenced by seasonal factors associated with the summer recess, they showed in the first month of the year a lower monthly expansion rate, which was reflected mainly in the behavior of commercial lines (overdrafts on current accounts and documents) and credit card financing, while the remaining lines showed growth rates similar to those of previous months.

• Interest rates paid by private financial entities for peso deposits of up to 35 days, both in the wholesale and retail tier, did not register variations with respect to the previous month. Indeed, the monthly average of the BADLAR remained at 11.1%, while the corresponding one for the retail tier (up to $100 thousand) was around 9.2%.

• Interest rates charged on commercial loans to the private sector showed dissimilar behaviors, while decreases were observed in those applied to financing with real guarantees. Meanwhile, rates on consumption-related lines remained relatively stable with respect to the previous month. The average monthly interest rate on overdrafts on current accounts decreased 0.4 p.p., positioning itself at around 18.8%. On the other hand, the one corresponding to single-signature documents was positioned at 15.3%, after increasing 0.5 p.p. in January, while the interest rate on discounted document financing closed the month at 13.5%, increasing 0.1 p.p.. In contrast, the rate on mortgage loans decreased 0.9 p.p., positioning itself at 13.7%; while the interest rate on loans with chattel mortgage guarantee was positioned at 17%, declining 0.4 p.p..

• The stock of international reserves reached its historical maximum level, positioning itself on the last day of January at u$s52,618 million. Said level meant an increase of u$s430 million with respect to the previous month, principal[ly—text appears to be cut off]
driven by the purchases of foreign exchange by the Central Bank within the framework of its managed floating exchange rate policy.

 In January, total means of payment (M2) reached

 Its monthly increase was driven essentially

 consequence of the high demand for transactional

 in time placements, also at the end of 2010). Another
 important factor was loans to the private sector (see
 Chart 2.1), which continued promoting high secon-
 dary money creation, despite having slowed its monthly
 growth rate due to seasonal reasons (see Loans sec-
 tion). Foreign exchange purchases carried out by the
 Central Bank in the market also generated an expansive
 effect. Meanwhile, the growth shown by time place-
 ments of the private sector generated a contraction
 that partially offset the mentioned expansive effects.

 Regarding primary money creation, the

3. Bank Liquidity¹

In the second month of the three-month count of the
Minimum Cash position, financial entities modified
the composition of their liquidity in pesos, while
the liquidity ratio (defined as the sum of cash in
banks, the current account of entities at the
BCRA, repo operations with the BCRA and holdings of LE-
BAC and NOBAC in terms of total deposits in

 Chart 3.1 pesos) increased slightly, in a context in which the

Meanwhile, the accumulated integration of the first two
months (December and January) of the three-month
count of the Minimum Cash position was 16.2% of total
deposits in pesos, 0.3 p.p. higher than the accumulated
requirement in the period (see Chart 3.2). Both public

 Minimum Cash position.

Through Communication "A" 5179, the extension of
the validity of the temporary reduction of the
minimum daily integration until April 30, 2011 was

 Chart 3.2 established². In this way, until that date, the daily
 value of the current account of entities at the BCRA

 Loans to the private sector continued to increase their year-over-year expansion rate. In particular, the year-over-year growth rate of peso-denominated credits increased 2.2 p.p. compared to December and reached 37.9%. Influenced by seasonal factors associated with the summer recess, peso-denominated loans to the private sector showed a slower monthly expansion rate in January. This deceleration was reflected mainly in the behavior of commercial lines (overdrafts on current accounts and documents) and credit card financing, while the rest of the lines presented growth rates similar to those of the previous months. In this context, the total of peso-denominated loans to the private sector grew in January 2.9% ($4,775 million; see Chart 4.1).

 Regarding loans with real guarantee, mortgage loans
 registered the largest monthly increase since December
 2008 with an average variation of 2.5% ($520 million). In
 the same direction, pledged loans continued with the
 momentum of previous months, accompanying increasing
 automobile sales.

 Pledged Loans and Automobile Sales
thousand motor vehicles. In this way, they registered in the month an increase of 4.5% ($425 million; see Chart 4.3). It is worth noting that 82% of the amounts granted in January, which totaled around $850 million, were destined for individuals, with the remainder corresponding to SMEs and other legal entities. Likewise, when breaking down the loans granted in January by amount bracket, it is observed that approximately 60% of the total corresponded to brackets below $50,000 (see Chart 4.4).

Loans in foreign currency to the private sector showed a growth rate similar to that of the two previous months, registering an increase in their average monthly balance of 4.9% (US$360 million), and a year-on-year variation of 44.3%.

Finally, it is worth mentioning that in January a new auction of funds was held under the Bicentennial Productive Financing Program (PFP), which aims to grant long-term funds to financial entities in order to improve the supply of credit for investment and productive activity. On this occasion, the total amount of auctioned resources amounted to $470 million, of which $455 million were awarded. In this way, $1,025 million have been awarded to date. The interest rate to be paid by each financial entity will be 9% nominal annual on the awarded funds, while the total financial cost for the respective borrowers will be up to 9.9% nominal annual. As collateral for the disbursed funds, each financial entity must allocate public securities and/or Guaranteed Loans issued by the National Government that represent at least 125% of the amount that has been assigned to it.

## 5. Interest Rates

Interest Rates of LEBAC and NOBAC Securities issued by the BCRA

In January, the interest rates of LEBAC and NOBAC placed in the primary market did not present significant variations compared to the previous month, while the total amount awarded increased considerably, explained by the strong growth of NOBAC. LEBAC for longer maturities were placed at interest rates lower than those in December, while NOBAC awards were made with similar margins over the BADLAR of private banks to those of the previous month for all comparable maturities (see Chart 5.1).
As was the case in December, a new contractionary monetary effect was recorded due to LEBAC and NOBAC auctions. Consequently, at the end of January the stock of securities in circulation amounted to $77,600 million (FV), 4.4% higher than that of December 2010. Given the notable preference in the month's auctions for instruments with variable rate returns, the stock of NOBAC grew more than 26%, gaining representation in the total of securities. After having reached minimum levels in May 2010 (a stock close to $2,000 million), in January 2011 these instruments once again represented 43% of the total securities, exceeding a level of $33,400 million (FV). For its part, LEBAC in circulation accumulated a decline of 27% from its maximum reached in October 2010 (see Graph 5.2), and ended January at a level of $44,200 million (FV).

LEBAC $ - 16.4

The stock of LEBAC and NOBAC in terms of other relevant monetary variables, such as international reserves, the monetary aggregate M3* or the monetary base, remained well below the values that were reached in mid-2007, prior to the deepening of the international financial crisis.

In the secondary market, driven by growth in both instruments, a higher amount traded was recorded compared to the previous month. Indeed, operations with NOBAC doubled, highlighting negotiations with securities of up to one year maturity. In the case of LEBAC, the largest operations were carried out mainly with securities whose maturities do not exceed one month, while their interest rates were slightly lower than those of the previous month.

## Interfinancial Markets

## Repo Market¹

Central Bank repo interest rates remained at the same levels as December. Passive repo rates were placed at 9% and 9.5%, for 1 and 7 days maturity, respectively, while the interest rates for active repos of 1 and 7 days were at 11% and 11.5%, respectively.

In January, the average stock of net repos (passive minus active) for the Central Bank, including all modalities of operations in which this Institution participates, increased by around $2,400 million and was placed at a level close to $11,800 million. It should be noted that no active repos were granted in the month, within the framework of the adequate liquidity levels that continued to prevail. Of the average balance of the total passive repos of the Central Bank, 40% was conducted at 1 day maturity, while 60% was done at 7 days.

## Interbank Market¹

In January, interest rates in the interbank market (call) averaged 9.8% for the total of operations, while for those conducted at 1 business day the monthly average was 9.7%, with an increase in both cases of 0.1 p.p. compared to December. For its part, the average of the interest rate in the repo market between financial entities (excluding the Central Bank) at 1 business day was 9.8%, 0.1 p.p. more than in December (see Graph 5.3).

The daily average of the amount traded during the month in the call market was placed at values similar to those

# REPO OPERATIONS BETWEEN FINANCIAL ENTITIES

**Call (total of banks)** recorded in recent months and reached $810 million, $25 million more than during December. For its part, the daily average of the amount traded in the repo market between financial entities in the 1 business day segment was $1,670 million, $120 million less compared to December.

The dispersion measures of interbank loan interest rates continued to indicate conditions of stability. In particular, the difference between the monthly average of the maximum and minimum interest rate agreed each day was 3.3 percentage points in January, while the standard deviation of operations was 0.5%. On the other hand, the deviation of repo operations between banks also stood at reduced values (0.3%).

# PASSIVE INTEREST RATES¹

**Graph 5.4**

The interest rates paid by private financial entities for peso deposits of up to 35 days, both in the wholesale and retail segments, did not register variations compared to the previous month. In effect, the monthly average of the BADLAR in January remained at 11.1%, while the corresponding retail segment (up to $100 thousand) stood at around 9.2% (see Graph 5.4).

In the BADLAR futures market, a high amount traded was registered, more than double that in December, with lower interest rates. In effect, the interest rate for contracts maturing at the end of March stood at around 11.3%, decreasing 0.2 percentage points compared to those traded in December with the same maturity. As in the previous month, the longest maturity traded corresponded to contracts maturing in September 2012, with an interest rate at around 14.75% (0.6 percentage points lower than that traded in December).

# ACTIVE INTEREST RATES¹

**Graph 5.5**

In the first month of the year, interest rates on commercial loans in the private sector presented dissimilar behaviors, while decreases were observed in those applied to financings with real guarantees. Meanwhile, interest rates on consumption-related lines remained relatively stable compared to the previous month (see Graph 5.5).

On one hand, the average monthly interest rate on current account advances decreased 0.4 percentage points, standing at around 18.8%. However, the corresponding most traded segment of that line (intended for companies for more than $10 million and up to 7 days maturity) did not register changes compared to December, remaining at 11.1%. Regarding the rest of commercial loan interest rates, they registered slight increases during the month. In effect, the rate corresponding to single signature documents stood at 15.3%, after increasing 0.5 percentage points in January, while the interest rate for discounted document financings closed the month at 13.5%, increasing 0.1 percentage points.

For its part, the average interest rates on lines intended to finance longer-term loans registered monthly decreases. On one hand, the rate for...
# Monetary Report | January 2011 | BCRA | 10

mortgage loans decreased by 0.9 percentage points, positioning itself at 13.7%; while the interest rate of loans with pledge guarantee was placed at 17%, retreating 0.4 percentage points.

Finally, the interest rates of loans intended for family consumption did not register significant changes. In effect, the average monthly interest rate of personal loans was positioned at 29.1%, at the same level as the previous month. Meanwhile, the one corresponding to credit cards reversed the declining behavior of recent months and increased 0.2 percentage points, positioning itself around 31.4%.

## 6. International Reserves and Foreign Exchange Market

The stock of international reserves reached a historical maximum level, positioning itself on the last day of January at US$52,618 million (see Chart 6.1). This level signified an increase of US$430 million with respect to the previous month. Among the factors that explained such an increase are the foreign currency purchases of the Bank in the Single and Free Exchange Market (MULC), and the increase in current accounts in foreign currency of financial entities in the Central Bank, related to the issuance of debt in foreign currency by a provincial government. The effect of the aforementioned factors was partially compensated by the decrease in the balance of said current accounts as a result of the application of resources to the granting of loans to the private sector in foreign currency.

On the other hand, by virtue of Decree 2054/10, in January the account corresponding to the Argentine Debt Relief Fund was settled for US$7,504 million, intended for the cancellation of public debt services with private holders corresponding to Fiscal Year 2011. It should be noted that such operation did not affect the balance of international reserves as it involved an account established in the Central Bank.

In the foreign exchange market, the average quotation for January of the United States Dollar was 3.98 $/U.S.$. The monthly variation resulted 0.1% higher than the average quotation recorded in December (see Chart 6.2). In the forward market (ROFEX), the amount traded in United States Dollar futures contracts was reduced to half of what was recorded in the previous month, and was $548 million. In turn, with respect to the Real and the Euro, the Peso also depreciated, in a context of appreciation of such currencies with respect to the Dollar. Thus, the quotations were 2.38 $/Real and 5.33 $/Euro respectively, which signified a monthly increase of 1.3% for both cases.

# 7. Capital Markets

## Chart 7.1 Stocks

During January, the most relevant stock markets for the Argentine economy had a disparate behavior. In this sense, the variation between December and January of the MSCI Global measured in dollars registered an increase of 2.2% (see Chart 7.1). The largest increase was observed in the MSCI Europe which had an increase of 6.7%, followed by the S&P500 (the main index of the North American market) which increased 2.3%, and the MSCI Japan which had an almost neutral result with an increase of 0.1%.

During January, the main stock market indices in Latin America, measured in dollars, in a context of profit-taking, experienced a downward trend, with the exception of the MERVAL. The index with the largest decline was the IGPA (Chile; 6.2%), followed by the BOVESPA (Brazil; 4.3%), by the IPC (Mexico; 2.3%), and finally by the IGBVL (Peru; 0.8%). On the other hand, the MERVAL (Argentina) continued to show more favorable performance than the rest of the Latin American indices and in January it was the only one in the region that had growth (measured in dollars), which reached 1.6%.

In the month of January, the MERVAL index measured in local currency continued its upward trend that began towards the end of last August (see Chart 7.2), ending the first month of the year at 3,593 points. The index grew again by 2% during January and, in this way, reached growth over the last 12 months of 56.3%, concentrated entirely in the increase recorded during the last five months.

In January, the quotation of public securities had a disparate evolution within a context of lower volume traded in the local market, for a second consecutive month, as is expected due to seasonal factors.

In this context, the sovereign risk indicators of emerging economies registered changes of small magnitude, influenced by an increase in the yields of longer-term treasury bonds. The EMBI+, which measures the spreads of debt in foreign currency of emerging countries combined, increased 23 basis points (b.p.) to close the month at 271 b.p.. Meanwhile, the EMBI+ Argentina rose 56 b.p., reaching 552 b.p. at the end of the month. The EMBI Latam, which measures the spread of Latin American debt, increased 23 b.p., concluding the month at 329 b.p.. For its part, the indicator for Brazil showed a decrease of 10 b.p. to reach 179 b.p.. With respect to the spread of Credit Default Swaps (CDS) contracts at 5 years, Argentina's increased 23 b.p. with respect to the previous month, while Brazil's increased 8 b.p. (see Chart 7.3).

The volume traded of public securities (on average daily) in the local market was reduced from $1,020 million in December to $990 million in January, representing, nonetheless, an increase of almost $200 million with respect to January 2010.

Private Securities
After months of strong dynamism in the private debt market, in January 3 new placements of negotiable obligations (ON) were registered, for a total amount exceeding $850 million.

As in December, the majority of the amount placed was carried out in foreign currency, with the Financial Activities, Securities and Insurance sector standing out mainly. In fact, Tarjeta Naranja placed an ON for US$200 million at 6 years maturity. The same will pay semiannual interest at a fixed interest rate of 9% per annum.

Meanwhile, in the segment of securities in local currency, 3 series were registered for $56 million. Here, Banco Saenz placed $40 million at variable BADLAR rate of private banks plus a margin of 4.75%. Finally, Cosas Nuestras, through 2 series in pesos and at variable rate, placed ON for a total amount of $15 million. Of these, $5 million are short-term, paying a spread of 5.5% over BADLAR of private banks. For its part, the other $10 million corresponded to the longer maturity one (6 years) and will pay a margin of 7.5% over the same rate.

## Mutual Investment Funds

During January, Mutual Investment Funds (FCIs), in pesos and in foreign currency, again registered an increase, ending the month with a total equity of $21,000 million. Said increase implied a monthly increase of 2.5% and year-on-year of 37.3%. It is the first time in 3 years that the equity of FCIs grows throughout the first month of the year.

On one hand, FCIs in pesos closed the month with a total equity of $19,150 million, increasing 2.6% compared to December, driven exclusively by fixed income funds. In effect, these funds grew 10.8% and increased their participation in total equity to 37% (+2.7 p.p., see Graph 7.4). To a much smaller extent, variable income and mixed income funds increased 4.8% and 3.4% respectively, almost without affecting their participations (9.8% and 7.8%). In the case of Money Market funds, their equity decreased 3.8% and along with it their participation also fell to 45.5% (-3 p.p.). With the exception of Money Market funds, whose evolution was determined by the amount of quotas, the increase in the equity of FCIs in pesos was explained both by the evolution of their respective prices and by the amount of quotas.

For its part, FCIs in foreign currency registered an increase of 1.1%, ending the month at US$457 million ($1,850 million). This variation was explained by increases in the fixed income brackets (1.1%) (excluding FF of infrastructure) and mixed income (1.4%), offsetting the declines in the variable income segments (-2%) and in Money Market (-2.6%). In all cases, the variations were attributed equally to movements in prices and in the amount of quotas.

## Financial Trusts

The emissions of Financial Trusts (FF) totaled around $650 million in January. As usually occurs during the first month of each year, after the period of greater typical spending at year-end (which gives rise to the securitization of a greater volume of assets), the emissions of FF registered a decrease (see Graph 7.5). In effect, if the FF intended to finance infrastructure projects are excluded, the amount

# Monetary Report | January 2011 | BCRA | 14

placed in January was 37% lower than in December. However, when comparing with the same month of the previous year, an increase of 23% is observed. In the same direction, the quantity of FF placements tends to increase in the months of December, decreasing significantly in January. In this way, 15 operations were registered in the month, 11 fewer than in December (not considering infrastructure FF).

Securitizations of Personal Loans
Participation in the Total
Jan-11

Among the underlying assets, personal loans continued to prevail, representing 80% of the securitized assets in the month. The securitization of this type of underlying asset has been showing great dynamism recently, with an average monthly amount of $520 million registered during 2010, substantially higher than that observed in the previous year and similar to that of 2008 (see Graph 7.6). With 11% of the total, future cash flows associated with real estate (rental income, purchase vouchers, etc.) followed. The remainder corresponded to commercial loans (5% of the total) linked to agricultural activity and leasing contracts (4% of the total).

The main fiduciaries were retail businesses, being responsible for approximately 60% of the total issued in the month. Although they recorded a decrease in the total securitized assets (17% less than in December), the amount issued in January ($390 million) continued to be high, placing itself above what was placed on average during 2010. For their part, mutual societies, cooperatives and non-bank credit card issuers were fiduciaries of 25% of the total, with a decrease in their securitizations of 38% compared to the previous month. The remainder corresponded to agricultural companies, among others.

## Graph 7.7
% Cut-off Rates of FF (Class A titles in pesos with a duration of less than 14 months - weighted monthly averages by amount)

The cut-off interest rates of senior titles in pesos, which in all cases presented a duration of less than 14 months, showed dissimilar movements according to their type of return. However, with respect to titles awarded at fixed rates, where an increase of 2.8 p.p. was verified compared to December, only one operation was registered (with a cut-off rate of 16%). Meanwhile, in the case of titles with variable rates, where usually the majority of operations are concentrated, the cut-off rate was presented relatively stable. Indeed, it was placed at 13.6%, 0.3 p.p. below that registered the previous month (see Graph 7.7). For its part, the duration (weighted average by amount) of senior titles was reduced in January to practically half compared to that registered in December, reaching a value of 5.5 months, in line with the greater concentration of underlying assets in those linked to consumption.
