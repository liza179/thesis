(1) The Banks Index is a capitalization index constructed using the same methodology as Burcap. It includes shares of the banks:
 Galicia, Francés, Bansud, Supervielle, Suquía and Río de la Plata.
(2) The sovereign risk premium is measured as the difference between the return of the FRB and a US government bond of equal duration.
(3) Currency risk is measured as the difference between the return of the Consolidation Bonds (BOCONES) Pro1 in pesos and Pro2 in dol-
 lars, which allow separating the exposure of the local currency by having the same duration and identical sovereign and interest rate risk.
