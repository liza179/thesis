# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information
 Communication No. 37255

## Monetary Situation (March 2000)

During March, deposits increased by 0.4% ($300 million), accumulating an increase of 1.1% during the first quarter of the year. This growth is explained fundamentally by fixed-term placements in dollars, since the rest of deposits remained at the levels observed the previous month.

It should be noted that as of this information, deposit figures come from the CENtralized SYStem of information requirements, therefore they do not incorporate sight and time obligations subject to minimum liquidity requirements that were included in the "Other deposits and obligations" item in the previous information requirement. It is for this reason that in this edition, and for the only time, a line called "Deposits and other obligations" has been included where the total deposits are added to the stock of obligations reported by the entities under the previous regime (S001) on December 30, 1999, solely for the purpose of obtaining data comparable to what was being published.

For their part, loans showed a new decline and decreased by 0.7% in the month, accumulating a decrease of 0.8% in the year. Loans directed to the private sector, especially commercial ones, continued to decrease while loans to the public sector maintained the growth of recent months.

The integration of minimum liquidity requirements remained at the levels evidenced in February, representing 21.6% of deposits.

Interest rates, in general, showed a significant decline on average (more than 1 percentage point), reaching levels similar to those from mid-1999.

## Private Banks (data as of January 2000)

The total assets of private banks registered an increase of 4.2% between December 1999 and January 2000, recovering in part from the loss of 6.6% in the previous month. This was due fundamentally to a growth in spot purchase-sale operations for settlement, which are recorded in the "Other credits for financial intermediation" item (which, for its part, increased 16.2%).

The holding of liquid assets—cash and cash equivalents, public and private securities and liquidity integration—increased slightly by $200 million, that is, 1.0%.

Total loans fell by $250 million (0.5%), also registering some important changes in their composition. Loans to the public sector maintained their upward trend while interbank loans and those directed to the private sector registered declines. Finally, loans to non-residents grew by $250 million (45%).

During January, deposits grew by almost $1,300 million (2.4%), due to the recovery from the sharp decline registered in December, caused in turn by both the usual withdrawal of deposits during year-end and by the concern about possible effects of the year 2000 problem. For their part, foreign credit lines decreased by $940 million (14.1%), returning to the level registered in November. Likewise, a slight decline was observed in the balance of negotiable obligations ($115 million, that is, 3.3%).

After two consecutive months of losses, private banks registered profits in January of 5.4% (annualized) of net equity. The main causes of this improvement were higher income from holdings of financial assets, lower charges for loan losses and administrative expenses; likewise, strong income was recorded from other financial results and miscellaneous profits. On the other hand, the differential between income and expenses from interest and, to a lesser extent, the result from services decreased significantly.
