The BCRA maintained unchanged reference interest rates throughout June. In particular, the monetary policy interest rate (LELIQ 28 days) remained at 97% n.a. (154.9% e.a.) and in real terms remained balanced with respect to both observed and expected inflation, which contributes to financial and exchange rate stability.

Transactional means of payment continued to contract at constant prices. Thus, private transactional M2 in terms of GDP continued to be located at minimum levels of the last 20 years. At the level of its components, this behavior was more marked in the case of currency in circulation, which reached a new minimum in terms of Product. With regard to remunerated instruments, at constant prices, private sector fixed-term deposits in pesos registered a slight contraction in June, although they persist around maximum values of recent decades in terms of Product. In this context, the broad monetary aggregate (private M3) at constant prices and without seasonality would have registered a contraction in the sixth month of the year and was located at 17.3% of GDP.

In relation to banking credit assistance, despite the boost from the Productive Investment Financing Line (LFIP), loans in pesos to the private sector showed a decline in the month, which was widespread across major credit lines.

Finally, International Reserves continued to reflect the low dynamism of the foreign exchange market in a context of record drought to which was added, on the last day of the month, the impact of a payment to the IMF of US$2,680 million, paid with SDRs and yuan from the currency swap agreement with the People's Bank of China.

Monthly Monetary Report | June 2023 | BCRA | 2 2. Means of payment
Means of payment (private transactional M2¹), in real terms and adjusted for seasonality (s.a.), would have registered a contraction of 1.9% in June, and in this way accumulate a decline on the order of 10% in the year. This dynamic responded to the behavior of currency in circulation held by the public, while non-remunerated sight deposits remained relatively stable (see Chart 2.1). In the year-over-year comparison, and at constant prices, private transactional M2 would be situated 19% below the level of June 2022.

As a ratio of Output, means of payment would have been situated at 7.6%, showing a decrease (0.2 p.p.) with respect to the previous month and around its minimum values of the last 20 years (see Chart 2.2). In particular, currency in circulation held by the public reached a new historical low, while sight deposits are situated, in terms of GDP, slightly above the minimum values reached at the end of 2019.

## 3. Savings Instruments in Pesos

The BCRA Board decided to maintain unchanged the guaranteed minimum interest rates for fixed-term deposits in the sixth month of the year². The decision was made considering that the real return on investments in local currency is in positive territory with respect to both observed and expected inflation, which contributes to financial and exchange rate stability. Thus, the guaranteed minimum interest rate for placements of natural persons was maintained at 97% a.r. (154.3% e.a.), while for the rest of depositors in the financial system the guaranteed minimum interest rate persisted at 90% a.r. (138.3% e.a.)³.

Fixed-term deposits in pesos of the private sector would have registered a contraction of 0.7% s.a. at constant prices in June. Nevertheless, these placements remained around the maximum levels of recent decades. Similarly, as a percentage of GDP, said deposits would have been situated at 7.6% in June (0.1 p.p. less than in May), a value similar to the maximum reached at the start of the pandemic.

Analyzing the evolution of term placements by amount strata, it is observed that the monthly contraction concentrated in deposits of up to $20 million and resulted more marked in the retail segment (less than $1 million; see Chart 3.1). Meanwhile, the wholesale segment (more than $20 million) remained relatively stable, with heterogeneous behavior by type of instrument. Indeed, traditional placements grew throughout the month, a dynamic that was more than offset by the decline registered in investments with early redemption option (see Chart 3.2).

¹ Corresponds to private M2 excluding remunerated sight deposits from companies and financial service providers. This component was excluded given that it resembles more a savings instrument than a means of payment.

² The interest rates currently in force are those established through communication "A" 7726.

³ The rest of depositors is comprised of Natural Persons with deposits of more than $30 million and legal persons.

The segment of fixed-term deposits adjustable by CER continued experiencing a contraction in real terms, accumulating 11 consecutive months of decline. By instrument type, placements in traditional UVA as well as pre-cancelable ones decreased at a similar rate, with monthly variation rates of -5.3% s.e. and -6% s.e. respectively (see Chart 3.3). Distinguishing by type of holder, the decrease was fundamentally due to the dynamics of placements by individuals, which represent approximately 75% of the total. In any case, the balance of deposits in UVA reached $318,580 million at the end of June, which is equivalent to 2.7% of the total fixed-term instruments denominated in domestic currency.

On the other hand, deposits with adjustment based on the value of the reference exchange rate experienced a decline in the sixth month of the year, although with heterogeneous behavior at the level of its components. Sight deposits with exchange rate adjustment experienced an average monthly expansion of 11.7% at constant prices, favored by the carryover effect from the previous month, reaching a balance of $484,300 million at the end of June. Indeed, the variation between end-of-month balances resulted in -14.7% in real terms, reflecting the use of funds obtained through the sale of dollars through the "Export Increase Program" (PIE). Meanwhile, DIVA dollar, fixed-term deposits, reached a balance of $52,255 million at the end of the month, which implied an average monthly contraction of 3.6% at constant prices (see Chart 3.4).

The broad monetary aggregate, private M3, at constant prices and adjusted for seasonality, would have exhibited in June a monthly decline of 1.4%⁴. In year-on-year terms, this aggregate would have experienced a decrease of 5.3%. As a percentage of GDP it would have been located at 17.3%, exhibiting a decrease (0.3 p.p.) with respect to the previous month and remaining in line with the average for the 2010-2019 period.

4. Monetary Base

In June, the average of the Monetary Base reached $5,603.8 billion, experiencing a monthly increase of 3.9% ($211,049 million) at current prices. Adjusted for seasonality and at constant prices, it would have exhibited a decrease of 4.7%, with a year-on-year decline of around 33%. As a ratio of GDP, the Monetary Base would be positioned at 3.8%, a figure 0.2 p.p. below the value recorded in the previous month and around the minimum values since the exit from convertibility (see Chart 4.1).

On the supply side, the average monthly expansion of the Monetary Base was explained in large part by the positive statistical carryover left by the foreign currency purchases made under the "Export Increment Program" during May. Another factor in liquidity expansion was the BCRA's operations in the secondary sovereign debt market, aimed at limiting excessive volatility. These factors were partially offset by the dynamics of monetary regulation instruments and public sector operations (see Chart 4.2). Finally, it should be noted that on the last day of the month the National Treasury requested a Temporary Advance of $688,000 million to make the payment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) scheduled for June 30, in a context where negotiations for the recalibration of the extended facilities program with the multilateral organization led to a delay in the disbursement corresponding to the fifth review thereof. In this way, the funds were destined for the acquisition of foreign currency, which is why this operation would have no monetary effect.

Regarding the composition of remunerated liabilities, in June the 28-day LELIQs represented, on average, 71.1% of the total. The longer-term species, mainly concentrated through NOTALIQs, represented only 2% of the June balance. On the other hand, 1-day reverse repos increased their participation in the total of instruments, reaching a representativeness of 23%. The remainder was made up of LEDIVs and LEGARs which increased their participation by 0.6 percentage points compared to May (see Chart 4.3).

Finally, the BCRA decided to keep its benchmark interest rates unchanged in June considering the deceleration of the inflation rate in May, the evolution of the leading indicators in June and future inflation prospects. The interest rate on 28-day LELIQs remained at 97.0% n.a. (154.9% e.a.), while the interest rate on 180-day LELIQs continued at 105.5% n.a. (133.8% e.a.). As for shorter-term instruments, the interest rate on 1-day reverse repos is at 91% n.a. (148.2% e.a.); while the interest rate on 1-day repos is at 116% n.a. (218.4% e.a.). Finally, the spread on NOTALIQs was 8.5 percentage points in the last auction, the same value it has recorded since September of last year.

5. Loans to the Private Sector

In June, loans in pesos to the private sector in real terms and without seasonality would have registered a monthly contraction of 1.7% and in the last 12 months would have accumulated a decline of around 13%. The dynamics of the month were homogeneous by type of financing (see Chart 5.1). As a percentage of GDP, loans in pesos to the private sector fell slightly in the month and were positioned at 6.4% (see Chart 5.2).

Lines with mainly commercial destination would have fallen 2.3% in real terms, with declines in both loans executed through documents and through advances in current accounts. Indeed, loans granted through documents would have exhibited a decrease of 0.9% s.e. in real terms and would be positioned just 0.3% below their level from a year earlier. This behavior responded mainly to the evolution of single-signature documents (-1.9% s.e.), while discounted documents presented an increase (2.2% s.e. monthly). For their part, advances would have registered a contraction at constant prices of 5.6% s.e., positioning themselves 12.6% below the June 2022 level.

The Productive Investment Financing Line (LFIP) continued to be the main tool used to channel credit to the productive activity of Micro, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs). At the end of June, loans granted under the LFIP framework accumulated $6,272 billion since its launch, with an increase of 7.8% compared to the previous month (see Chart 5.3). Of the total financings granted through the LFIP, 13.9% corresponds to investment projects and the rest to working capital. It should be noted that the average balance of financings granted through the LFIP reached approximately $1,663 billion in May (latest available information), which represents about 18.5% of total loans and 41.2% of total commercial loans.

In terms of GDP, credit to relatively smaller-sized companies was positioned around 1.7%, above the pre-pandemic record and the historical average. In contrast, in the case of large companies, the credit-to-GDP ratio remains around minimum values in historical terms (see chart 5.4).

Consumer loans would have fallen 0.9% s.e. at constant prices during the month and would accumulate a reduction of 14.6% in the last 12 months. Within these lines, financings executed with credit cards would have shown an increase in real terms of 0.5% s.e. in June (-10.2% y.o.y.). For their part, personal loans would have exhibited a monthly decline of 3.7% s.e. and 21.7% year-over-year.

With regard to lines with real collateral, at constant prices, pledged loans would have registered a contraction of 1.1% s.e., positioning themselves around 12.0% below the level from a year earlier. For their part, the balance of mortgage credit would have shown a monthly decline of 3.7% s.e., with a fall of 40.4% in the last 12 months.

6. Liquidity in pesos of financial entities
In June, broad banking liquidity in local currency5 showed a new increase of 3.9 p.p. with respect to May, averaging 82.7% of deposits (see Graph 6.1). In this way it remained at historically elevated levels. The increase was explained mainly by LELIQs, passive repos and integration with BOTE 2025-27 and other integrable bonds, partially offset by NOTALIQs and current accounts in the Central Bank. With respect to BOTE, it is worth mentioning that at the end of May the new National Treasury Bond in pesos maturing on August 23, 20256 was auctioned, suitable for integration of minimum cash, which explains the increase in said item.

Regarding normative changes with potential impact on banking liquidity, it was established that the reduction of the minimum cash requirement in pesos based on cash withdrawals through the entity's automated teller machines will apply to withdrawals made at automated teller machines located in municipalities included in categories III to VI7.

5 Includes current accounts at the BCRA, cash in banks, balances of net repos arranged with the BCRA, holdings of LELIQs and NOTALIQs and public bonds eligible to integrate reserve requirements.

## 7. Foreign Currency

In the foreign currency segment, the main assets and liabilities of financial entities had disparate behavior. On one hand, private sector deposits ended June with a balance of US$15,424 million, which implied an increase of US$144 million with respect to the end of May. It is worth noting that at the end of the sixth month of the year, the Chinese yuan renminbi was incorporated as an admitted currency for capturing deposits in savings accounts and current accounts8. On the other hand, the balance of loans to the private sector fell US$149 million and ended the month at US$3,834 million (see Graph 7.1).

The liquidity of financial entities in the foreign currency segment experienced a decline of 0.8 p.p. with respect to the May average, placing itself at 82.5% of deposits and remaining at historically elevated levels (see Graph 7.2).
During June, a series of regulatory modifications in exchange matters took place, aimed at favoring an efficient allocation of International Reserves. Among them, those referring to access to the foreign exchange market to make import payments stand out. In turn, the subjects susceptible to subscribing to BCRA bills with adjustment based on the Reference Exchange Rate quotation were modified. For its part, with the intention of continuing with a debt reduction process at a pace that is compatible with the foreign exchange needs of the economy and exchange rate stability, guidelines were issued to order the debt reduction of provinces in foreign currency. Finally, the swap with the People's Bank of China (PBoC) was renewed for 3 years for 130,000 million yuan; while the process of requesting an expansion of activation was initiated for an amount of up to 35,000 million yuan.

The BCRA's International Reserves ended June with a balance of US$ 27,926 million, registering a decrease of US$ 5,075 million compared to the end of May (see Chart 7.3). This fall was mainly explained by the payment to the International Monetary Fund for approximately US$ 2,680 million, which was made through the use of SDRs and yuan from the activation of the swap with the PBoC. Other factors that had an impact, although to a lesser extent, were foreign exchange sales to the private sector — in the context of a record drought —, the decline in minimum cash balances accounts, and the loss from valuation of external liabilities.

Finally, the nominal bilateral exchange rate (TCN) with respect to the US dollar increased 7.4% in June, an increase greater than that of the previous month (see Chart 7.4). In this way, the nominal exchange rate was located, on average, at $ 248.31/US$ in the sixth month of the year.
