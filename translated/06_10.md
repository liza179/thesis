 Securities Issued by the BCRA 5 • The BCRA continued with its prudential policy of accumulation of
 international reserves, which allowed it to raise the stock to US$29,082
 Interfinancial Markets 5 million at the end of October, reaching the highest level of the post
 Convertibility period. The present accumulation derives from a solid
 Repurchase Agreement Market 5 trade surplus balance and not from the increasing external debt
 characteristic of the previous decade. The monetary expansion generated
 Interbank Market 6 by the purchase of foreign currency was sterilized with different
 instruments, ensuring equilibrium in the monetary market. Through the
 Passive Interest Rates 7 placement of LEBACs and NOBACs and the arrangement of repurchase
 agreements, the Monetary Base was contracted by $978 million and the
 Active Interest Rates 7 public sector also originated a monetary contraction of $344 million.
 Likewise, the two entities that maintain illiquid balances paid their

 contraction of $131 million.
 7. Capital Markets 8 • Time deposits continued to grow during the month, both those of the

 million. So far this year, time deposits in pesos have accelerated their
 Public Securities 9 growth rate which reached 30% y.o.y., accumulating an increase of
 $15,900 million.
 Institutional Investors 10 • Loans also accelerated their growth rate. In October, total loans to
 the private sector (in pesos and foreign currency) increased by $2,500
 Pension Fund Administrators 10 million (3.7%). In year-on-year terms, it accumulates a nominal increase
 of 43.5% and 28.6% in real terms, reaching new highs. Growth continues

## 2. Monetary Aggregates¹

**Graph 2.1 - Evolution of M2 and Monetary Program**

(thousands of millions of $)

The means of payment (M2) were located at $114,750 million, in line with the lower trajectory provided for in the 2006 Monetary Program (see Graph 2.1). M2 continued showing a deceleration in its year-on-year growth rate. The same behavior was evident in the year-on-year growth of currency in circulation, which has already accumulated a decline of 6.6 percentage points compared to December 2005.

Demand deposits in pesos increased by $1,740 million this month, both those of the private sector ($1,080 million) and those of the public sector ($660 million). In the latter case, the increase took place in the segment of placements in current accounts, where funds from tax collection are allocated. For its part, among demand deposits of the private sector, the growth was distributed in practically equal parts between deposits in current accounts and savings accounts. With respect to the latter, it is important to note the behaviors that influenced their evolution.

**Graph 2.2 - Time Deposits in Pesos**

(thousands of millions of $)

Public Sector + Private Sector

On one hand, the BCRA continued implementing regulatory changes in order to promote the lengthening of the financing structure of entities and thus stimulate long-term credit. In this sense, with effect from October, it again decreased – from 50% to 35% of the BADLAR private banks – the maximum interest rate for demand accounts from which a 100% reserve requirement is applied to said accounts. This measure would have encouraged a transfer of funds from remunerated current accounts toward time placements and Money Market Mutual Funds (FCI). On the other hand, the National Securities Commission (CNV) arranged from mid-October changes in the regulations that govern the composition of the portfolio of money market funds, reducing the maximum allowed proportion of assets valued at accrual (among which time deposits are included). This regulatory change originated temporary transfers from time placements toward demand deposits.

Time deposits continued to increase, although the increase was smaller than that recorded in past months, which would be partly explained by the already commented behavior of the FCI. Fixed-term deposits totaled an increase of $870 million in the month, of which $540 million corresponded to the public sector and $330 million to the private sector. However, in the latter case, if the variation in the balance of deposits between the end of September and October is considered, it is observed that the monthly increase was significantly larger and reached $700 million. In this way, so far this year fixed-term deposits in pesos have significantly increased their growth rate and have accumulated an increase of $15,900 million or 32% (30% annualized) (see Graph 2.2).

**Graph 2.3 - Monetary Aggregates**

For its part, deposits in dollars registered a monthly increase of US$140 million, which was explained in its...

Meanwhile, in public banks the BADLAR interest rate rose during the first days of the month and then began to decline due to the larger placements made by the public sector, which typically operates at rates below the average (see Chart 5.6).

 22 quotation of the peso against the dollar fell 0.05% and was located at 3.098 $/US$ in
 October (see Chart 6.2). Among the factors that could have

 18 induced this appreciation of the peso is found the high
 settlement of foreign currency by exporters and the decrease in holding
 14
 of liquid assets in foreign currency by financial entities

 10 (General Foreign Exchange Position), among others. Also the
 peso evidenced an appreciation of 0.8% with respect to the euro,

 6 ending the month at an average value of 3.912 $/€. On the other hand,
 Jul-01 Apr-02 Jan-03 Oct-03 Jul-04 Apr-05 Jan-06 Oct-06
 with respect to the real, the peso depreciated 0.7% on average,
 registering a value of 1.44 $/Real (see Chart 6.3).

 The volume of foreign currency traded decreased slightly with respect
 to the previous month, both in the spot market and in the futures market. In
 the former, it was mainly due to lower volume of
 transactions in the Electronic Foreign Exchange Market, while
 in the futures market lower amount traded was observed in the Term

## Equities

The MERVAL index, which groups the most representative shares of the local stock market, increased 8.8% in the month (see Chart 7.2). With the increase recorded in October, the cumulative return since the beginning of the year was 15.4%, and in the last 12 months 10.7%.

Chart 7.1
Annual Yield (%) Yield Curves of U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes and Bonds In the region, the stock market indices of the most relevant equity markets had an evolution in the same direction as Argentina's MERVAL index, corroborating the fact that the increase was more due to a phenomenon related to the stock market values of emerging economies, than to a specific event of profit expectations in Argentina. For comparative purposes, the increases measured in dollars were led by MERVAL and Bovespa (Brazil), which rose 9.3% and 9.1%, respectively, followed by the IPC (Mexico) which increased 7.3%. In the same way, although to a lesser extent, the IGPA (Chile) rose 5.6%, followed by the IGBVL (Peru) which increased 4%.

The volatility of returns in the local stock market continued with the downward trend it maintained in the second half, reaching values very close to the lows observed in the year. This evolution was very similar to that recorded in other stock markets in the region and to that of returns in stock market indices of developed markets (see Chart 7.3).

The volume of daily operations in the Buenos Aires securities market was $47 million on average, above the level of $34 million registered the previous month.

## Public Securities

The spreads of external debt of emerging countries, measured by the EMBI+, contracted significantly, by 19 p.b. In the Latin America region, the spreads registered a contraction of the same magnitude, led by Argentina and Brazil, whose spreads contracted by 52 p.b. and 15 p.b.

The yield curve of public securities in pesos remained almost in the same position as at the end of September. Likewise, as had been happening since that month, a slight steepening of the yield curve of public securities indexed in pesos (to the CER) was recorded. This change was due mainly to a decline in yields in the shorter term (See Charts 7.4 and 7.5). The yield curve of securities denominated in dollars, meanwhile, shifted towards lower yields in the shorter and longer term tranches, while in the middle tranches of the curve, it registered a certain increase. The prices of U.V.P. (Units Linked to GDP) continued with the trajectory observed since their issuance, with their valuation increasing in the month once again. The U.V.P. denominated in pesos (Argentine Law) and the one denominated in dollars (New York Law) both increased by 10.7%.

The average cut-off interest rates of FF issued in October showed disparate behaviors according to their duration. Class A senior securities in pesos, both at fixed and variable rates, remained relatively stable at 11.2% and 11.8% respectively, showing a slight upward trend (+0.1 p.p.).

On the other hand, regarding class B subordinated securities in pesos, with fixed and variable rates, their yield rose to 14% and 13.7% respectively, showing increases of 2.7 p.p and 1.5 p.p respectively, in relation to the previous month.
