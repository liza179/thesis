# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information
 Communiqué No. 34061

During March, deposits continued to show positive behavior. They increased on average $150 million, accumulating an increase for the year of 2.1%.
The growth in the month was verified in peso deposits and especially in fixed-term placements. For its part, loans to the non-financial private sector slowed their growth in March. However, they accumulated an increase for the year of 2.2%. The international reserves of the financial system experienced a decrease that accompanied the decline observed in monetary circulation.

The good liquidity conditions of the money market together with the continuous reduction in sovereign risk were reflected in the significant decline in both active and passive interest rates. On the other hand, financial entities slightly reduced their integration of minimum liquidity requirements although their relationship with respect to deposits remained above 21%.

Regarding the equity situation of private banks, the most notable was the increase in deposits, which grew 1% in January. Some of the other relevant variations in the period (decline in loans and the balance of negotiable obligations) were due to the fact that the balance sheets of entities that closed were written off. However, this did not affect the evolution of deposits, since those corresponding to the closed entities were acquired by other banks.

The profitability of private banks in January (in annualized terms, -0.3% on net equity) bore the effects of the crisis in Brazil on local financial markets. This was clearly observed in the decline in results from holdings of financial assets, a direct consequence of the fall in prices of bonds and shares, and the increase in volatility of capital markets.

The credit portfolio quality of private banks showed clear improvement, in part because the entities that were written off as of January maintained high irregularity rates. In this sense, the irregular portfolio in terms of financing fell 0.2 percentage points, reaching 6.6%. On the other hand, the irregular portfolio net of provisions in terms of financing remained stable around 2.3%.

The integration of capital for credit risk, in terms of assets weighted by risk according to the Basel criterion, fell slightly, passing from 17.1% to 16.8%.
