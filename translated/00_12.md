# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information
Communication No.: 39.130

## Monetary Situation (November 2000)

During November, the trend toward a fall in deposits that began to take shape from mid-October intensified. Considering average figures, total deposits fell 1% compared to the October average (approximately $1000 million), and the fall was verified both in sight deposits (mostly driven by public sector placements) and in time deposits.

Within the total deposits, those belonging to the private sector showed a fall of $750 million, of which almost $500 million corresponded to time placements mostly in local currency, so that the proportion of fixed-term deposits in dollars reached approximately 79.5% of the total.

In a context of increased country risk and growing difficulties in accessing international debt markets, the greater domestic financing needs of the public sector, and to a lesser extent the fall in deposits, led to domestic interest rates experiencing significant increases in the first days of November. Interest rates for interbank loans reached levels not seen since 1995. Faced with this liquidity situation, the Central Bank decided to make the regulations on meeting liquidity requirements more flexible: requirements were lowered for sight deposits of Mutual Investment Funds; a combined position for the November-January quarter was permitted; and later a deficit position of up to 20% of the requirement in the month of November was allowed. These measures, together with the announcement of financial support from international organizations, managed to ease the market, with a fall in interest rates observed to end-of-September levels.

The measures adopted by the Central Bank had as a consequence a fall in liquidity requirement integration substantially greater than the fall induced by the deposit decline. This determined an important decrease in international reserves of the financial system.

## Private Banks (data as of September 2000)

The total assets of private banks increased 2.0% during September, as they reflected the effects of an increase in the "Other credits from financial intermediation" item (3.4%) and secondly, an increase in total loans (1.4%). As for alternative sources of funding, the loan lines from abroad were the most used in the month, registering an increase of 9.5%.

In September 2000, private banks recorded earnings equivalent to 3.3% of net equity on annualized terms. Increases in loan loss provisions and administration expenses caused benefits to be lower than those recorded in the previous month; however, these effects were partially offset by the increase in results from holding financial assets. On the other hand, the third quarter of 2000 recorded greater benefits than the two previous quarters, reaching earnings of 5.5% of annualized net equity. Although for the group of private banks the annual cumulative profitability is almost null due to the performance of a particular bank in March 2000, this rises to 6.1% of annualized net equity when excluding that bank from the analysis.
The quality indicators of the credit portfolio of private banks showed a slight deterioration during September, particularly due to the increase in the irregular portfolio (3.3%), thus the irregular portfolio in terms of financing went from 8.3% to 8.5%. Likewise, coverage indicators also worsened, the irregular portfolio net of provisions in terms of financing increased 0.3 percentage points and stood at a level of 2.7%. On the other hand, equity exposure to credit risk, measured as the irregular portfolio net of provisions in terms of net equity, went from 11.6% to 13.1%.

During September, the total capital requirement of private banks fell approximately $120 million (1.6%), explained basically by the fall in the credit risk requirement (1.5%). Capital integration decreased $60 million (0.5%), due mainly to the decrease in basic net equity. However, the decrease in the requirement produced a net positive effect on the excess integration, which in terms of total capital requirement went from 52.7% to 54.4%. Finally, capital integration in terms of risk-weighted assets according to Basel increased 0.2 percentage points, standing at a level (20.9%) well above what is established by local regulation and by international minimum standards.
