# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information
Communication No: 42.354

## Monetary Situation (December 2001)

Following the sharp decline in system deposits on November 30 (approximately $1,800 million, that is, 2.5% in a single day), which anticipated a greater decline in the coming days, the National Executive Branch, by Decree 1570/01, decided to restrict the possibility of making withdrawals from entity accounts. This decision was adopted after an evaluation of potential risks: the massive withdrawal of deposits, taking into account the inability of entities to immediately collect on granted loans, would produce a generalized collapse of the system, whose consequence could have been the loss of depositors' savings.

The regulation initially allowed a monthly withdrawal of $1,000 (or dollars) per account holder, for all types of deposits held, an amount that was later increased by $500 but only for salary accounts (it was taken into consideration that December is a month when bonuses are paid). However, although there was a restriction on cash withdrawals, there was total freedom for movement between different accounts within the system, and the use of debit and credit cards was also encouraged. The implemented measure determined a significant transfer of time deposits (as they matured) toward demand placements.

Despite the restrictions imposed, total deposits fell by $2,100 million over the course of the month, although considering average figures the decline was $3,600 million as a consequence of the November 30 drop. Given the mentioned context, the international reserves of the financial system were reduced by $1,870 million (considering average figures).

Concurrent with the deposit decline, there was a concentration of deposits in a group of entities. Therefore, and for the purpose of regulating liquidity, the Central Bank initially established an additional requirement of minimum cash of 75% on the monthly average of the daily increase in deposits with respect to November 30. Subsequently, and as of December 27, it was decided to reduce the minimum cash requirements and liquidity requirements by 6 percentage points and simultaneously by Decree 32/01 the Banking Liquidity Fund (FLB) was created with a contribution of 5% of the average deposits of the private sector corresponding to November 2001. This Fund, which is administered by Deposit Insurance S.A. (SEDESA), will provide liquidity to those entities that require it.

Interest rates, for their part, remained at levels around 8 and 10% for time deposits. It should be mentioned that the Central Bank began to set reference interest rates, such that financial entities that paid interest rates higher than the margins established on those rates, had to establish reserve requirements equivalent to 100% of deposits raised at those rates.

## Private Banks (data as of October 2001)

During October 2001, there was again a decrease in total assets (2.8%) of private banks. On one hand, one of the main causes was the decline in total loans (2.2%), which in turn decreased as a consequence of the decline in loans to the non-financial private sector. It should be noted that the behavior of the latter was mainly driven by the negative evolution of documents, advances and mortgage loans. Second, the negative effect of available funds (10.5%), mainly due to the decline in total deposits, contributed significantly to the fall in total assets. Finally, net assets net of accounting duplications generated by repo operations, forward operations and spot transactions to be settled, registered a decline of 2.3%.
Regarding the behavior of alternative funding sources for private banking, foreign credit lines and negotiable obligations fell 3.4% and 0.3% respectively, accompanying the decline in total deposits of the sector.

Unlike the previous month, private banks obtained important profits during October 2001, reaching gains equivalent to 7.4% of net equity in annualized terms. The main changes, with respect to the previous month, were observed in the fall of loan loss provisions and in the increase in results from interest and services, derived particularly from the increase in gross income from interest and services respectively. In turn, the positive impact of these factors on the profitability of the month under analysis was partially reduced by the increase in administration expenses and by the accrual of income tax. Consequently, the benefits accumulated in 2001, through October, amounted to 6.5% of net equity in annualized terms.

The quality of the credit portfolio of private banks worsened during October 2001, as was recorded in the previous period. The increase in irregular portfolio (2.0%) and the fall in total financing (-1.5%) caused an increase in irregularity of 0.3 percentage points, ending the period at 10.1%. On the other hand, net exposure to credit risk –defined as the irregular portfolio minus provisions in terms of financing– grew, increasing from 2.9% to 3.2%. The effect of the behavior of financing and the irregular portfolio –given the relative stability of the provision level– contributed to increasing equity exposure to credit risk –defined as the irregular portfolio minus provisions in terms of net equity–, rising from 12.6% to 13.6%.

The total capital requirement of private banks registered a decline of 2.8% in October 2001, which was derived particularly from the decrease in capital requirement for counterparty risk (2.9%), which in turn reflects the negative effect of the evolution of risk-weighted assets. Regarding capital integration, no significant variations were recorded either in the total or in its components. Consequently, the excess of total capital integration in terms of total capital requirement registered a notable increase of 4.5 percentage points, placing itself at 56.0%. Likewise, total capital integration in terms of risk-weighted assets according to Basel rose 0.7 percentage points, establishing itself at a level (22.0%) much higher than what is established by local regulation and the minimum values recommended internationally.

Tables with the evolution of the main variables are attached.
