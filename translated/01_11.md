# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information
Communication No: 41.867

## Monetary Situation (October 2001)

After the recovery evidenced during September, the main monetary variables showed negative developments again throughout October, although of lesser magnitude than those observed during July and August.

Total deposits fell $320 million (0.4%) on average. However, if end-of-month balances are considered, the decrease was approximately $2,600 million, of which 67% corresponds to sight deposits. Regarding private sector deposits, the greatest contraction concentrated in the last week of the month, caused basically by the behavior of fixed-term and money market FCl investors, who withdrew funds for approximately $1,000 million.

International reserves, for their part, increased on average $400 million, although this increase was possible due to the "drag effect" caused by the IMF disbursement carried out in September (already mentioned in the previous report). In contrast, when observing end-of-month figures, international reserves decreased by almost $3,200 million, mostly as a result of the reduction in bank reserves to face deposit withdrawals. Likewise, currency in circulation continued showing declines, standing, on average, $360 million below the previous month.

Loans to the non-financial private sector continued showing a downward trend with an acceleration in the pace of decline. Thus, the average stock decreased by 1%, equivalent to $550 million.

The instability existing in the market caused high volatility in interest rates. In general terms, interest rates showed a progressive increase from the first day of the month until the 12th, date from which they decreased substantially to increase again in the final days of the month. Interest rates for fixed-term deposits in amounts greater than one million pesos up to 35 days registered a monthly average of 27.1% in pesos and 15.6% in dollars, while interbank loans reached 19.7% and 10.7%, respectively. It is worth noting that interbank interest rates remained below those of fixed-term placements throughout practically the entire period.

## Private Banks (data as of August 2001)

In August 2001, net assets for the aggregate of private banks continued their downward trajectory by falling 1.8%, and accumulated for the first 8 months of the year a decrease of approximately 10%. The main cause of the decline of that item was the reduction in the balance of loans granted to the non-financial private sector, which showed a negative variation of 3%. In relation to the evolution of total assets –without netting–, it could be observed that the same fell just over 5%, additionally reflecting the effect of the decrease in forward operations, especially those conducted with foreign currency.

Regarding the performance of alternative funding sources for private banking, the observed declines stood out in the balances of external credit lines, negotiable obligations and subordinated obligations, which together fell 2% in the month of August, and accompanied the negative behavior of sector deposits.
In the month under description, the group of private banks obtained accounting profits –in annualized terms– equivalent to 11% of net equity. The improvement in results –compared to the previous month– was derived from higher income from holdings of financial assets, especially public securities. This effect was partially offset, fundamentally, by the changes recorded in interest income results and in the amount accrued for income tax. It is worth mentioning that private banking accumulated for the first 8 months of the year an annualized return of approximately 8%, representing a figure 1.5 percentage points higher compared to what was observed in the same period a year before.

In terms of information on the quality of the financing portfolio, it is worth mentioning that the level of irregularity thereof –defined as the proportion of financing in situation 3, 4 and 5 in terms of the total– went from 9% to 9.3% between July and August of 2001. The increase in irregularity reflected the effects both of the decline in total financing (-1.3%) as well as the increase in the portfolio in irregular situation (1.7%). It is worth mentioning that the deterioration in portfolio quality –measured by its level of irregularity– in the last twelve months reached 1 percentage point, given the level of the indicator observed in August of 2000 of 8.3%.

In August of 2001, the solvency indicators for private banks did not observe a substantial modification with respect to the levels registered recently. Thus, in the month under consideration, the capital integration in terms of assets weighted by risk –according to the Basel Committee criteria– remained in the order of 21%, while the excess of integration in terms of the total capital requirement was sustained around 51%.
