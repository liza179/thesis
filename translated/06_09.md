## 2. Monetary Aggregates1

In September, the means of payment (M2) would have been located at $112,370 million, once again near the lower limit provided for in the Monetary Program (see Graph 2.1) and, consequently, the Central Bank completed 13 consecutive quarters of compliance with monetary targets.

Graph 2.1

thousands of Evolution of M2 and Monetary Program
The monthly variation of M2 was 0.4% and its year-on-year growth rate decreased by 5 p.p. compared to what it presented at the end of 2005, registering a nominal increase of around 20% y.o.y. in September 2006. The currency in circulation also showed a gradual deceleration in its year-on-year variation rate throughout the year, accumulating in 2006 a decline of almost 6 p.p..

Demand deposits in pesos registered a monthly increase of just $60 million and, while those of the private sector decreased $340 million, those of the public sector increased $400 million, driven by funds from tax collection. In the decline of private placements, the movement of placements greater than $1 million prevailed, where in the last two months – having surpassed the period of greatest seasonal demand for transactional money – the transfer from demand deposits to fixed-term deposits intensified (see Graph 2.2).

This transfer was a consequence of the measures implemented by the Central Bank aimed at encouraging the transfer of demand deposits toward fixed-term deposits in order to promote the lengthening of the funding structure of entities and thus stimulate long-term credit. In this sense, in September, and with effect from October, the maximum interest rate for demand accounts decreased again – from 50% to 35% of the BADLAR for private banks – from which such accounts are subject to a 100% reserve requirement.

In this context, fixed-term deposits continued to show significant dynamism and in September grew by $2,050 million. 66% of this increase was explained by the increase in private sector placements and it is important to note that, in addition to the aforementioned increase in placements greater than $1 million, those made in smaller amounts continued to exhibit sustained growth, which averaged around 3% monthly in the last five months. In this way, in what has accumulated so far this year, fixed-term placements accumulated an increase of 31%, significantly higher than what they presented in the same period of previous years: 19% in 2005 and 4% in 2004.

The broader peso aggregate (M3) registered a monthly increase of $2,660 million (1.5%).

In the dollar segment, deposits increased in the month by US$120 million, an increase that was explained by private sector deposits. The increase in placements of this sector was concentrated in fixed-term deposits, which increased by US$120 million, while demand deposits increased by US$60 million. On the contrary, public sector deposits decreased by approximately US$60 million. In this way, dollar deposits accumulate an increase of

US$1,300 million so far this year and exceed US$5,300 million on average in September.

In this way, the broadest aggregate in pesos and dollars, M3* presented a monthly increase of $3,150 million (see Chart 2.3).

Among the latter, in addition to the monthly matching installment, one bank decided to pay off in advance the entirety of its remaining debt for illiquidity assistance. As a consequence, only two entities remain with rediscount balances that had been granted during the 2001 crisis, compared to the 23 that had originally joined the matching scheme.

In September 2006, retail inflation was 0.9% monthly,

² Through Communication "A" 4549, the BCRA had established that as of September only 67% of the total cash maintained in entities, in custody, in transit or in cash carriers could be computed by banks as integration of Minimum Cash, and provided that this proportion would continue reducing by thirds during October and November. Subsequently, through Communication "A" 4580, it was decided to defer the application of this schedule as of October.
# 3 Monetary Report SEPTEMBER 2006

For the coming months, inflation would remain at levels lower than those of last year, allowing the variation in retail prices to remain within the range stipulated in the current Monetary Program.

 was due in part to banks reducing their reverse repo position with the BCRA this month

Source: BCRA entities reduced approximately 0.3 percentage points of deposits in their cash holdings,
 roughly $400 million (see Graph 3.1, right quadrant).

With preliminary figures from the main items of the balance sheet of entities, it can be seen that they used
basically their reverse repo position to apply to the increase in their current accounts (necessary to compensate for lower cash use as reserve requirement integration). Nevertheless, the increase in
deposits, the sale of part of the foreign currency they received in payment of
**Graph 3.2** their holdings of Government Bonds, and other funding sources, allowed them to repay

 integration was approximately US$150 million. Thus, given the existing surplus in the foreign currency segment, the partial

For its part, active interest rates continued without major variations at levels that result both in nominal and real terms lower than those prevailing during convertibility.

The average interest rate for advances stood at 16.3%, a level similar to that of the last four months, but more than one percentage point lower than the maximum recorded in March. Similarly, the interest rate for documents granted on single signature remained stable and presented an average of 12.7% (see Chart 5.7).

Interest rates on loans with real guarantees also remained stable. In the case of mortgage loans it was 11.6%, a level similar to that observed during the last two years (see Graph 5.8). Meanwhile, the interest rate on pledged loans, which is somewhat more volatile, rose 0.3 p.p. in the month to stand at 10.3%.

Finally, the interest rate on personal loans was 24.7%, without major variations, in a context of dynamic growth in new loans granted. Meanwhile, for financing with credit cards, the interest rate in the month of August, the latest available data, was 26.9%.

## 6. International Reserves and Foreign Exchange Market

The stock of international reserves ended September at US$28,048 million, recording an increase compared to the previous month of US$651 million (see Graph 6.1). BCRA purchases in the exchange market constituted the main factor in the inflow of foreign currency.

It is noteworthy that in September, in just nine months the BCRA has managed to restore the levels of international reserves that were observed at the beginning of January, before the payment to the IMF.

In the foreign exchange market, the peso depreciated against the U.S. dollar, unlike last month, 0.7%, standing at 3.10 $/US$. Against the real it also depreciated, although slightly, and stood at 1.43 $/Real. In contrast, against the euro the peso remained practically unchanged at 3.94 $/Euro.

The volumes of foreign currency traded both in the Spot market and in the Futures market decreased compared to the previous month. In particular, in the Spot market (through the Electronic Operations System -SIOPEL- and the Electronic Brokers Market -MEC-) the daily average traded was US$243 million, 2% lower in August due to the fact that the fall in SIOPEL offset the increase in the MEC. BCRA intervention in all of these markets represented 7% of total traded (see Graph 6.2). On the other hand, in the Futures market (MAE Futures Market and Rosario Term Market –ROFEX-) average daily operations of US$96 million were recorded in the month, 16% lower than those of the previous month (due to a decrease in ROFEX) but 49% higher than September 2005. BCRA participation in these venues was around 3%.

After the U.S. Federal Reserve left unchanged for the second consecutive time at 5.25% the Federal Funds rate on September 20, market participants centered their attention on U.S. economic activity data with the intention of anticipating whether the Federal Reserve would have concluded the interest rate increase cycle. This decision would take on marked importance for the impact it would have on asset valuations, both for developed and emerging markets. It is noteworthy that unlike the U.S., the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan maintained a gradual interest rate increase policy.

Chart 7.2
Yield Curves of U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes and Bonds
Annual Yield (%)

According to Federal Funds futures prices, expectations of future increases would have been nullified. On the other hand, the yield curve of U.S. Treasury bonds remained inverted during September and the data known during the month confirmed larger declines in long-term interest rates, which would also appear to reflect the perception that the Federal Funds rate increase cycle could have concluded. It is interesting to note that, as empirical regularity, it is verified that when the Federal Funds rate increase cycle reaches its maximum (peak), long-term rates begin with a prolonged decline. (See Chart 7.1).

These expectations were incorporated into financial asset prices during September. Indeed, the Dow Jones stock index reached a record level of 11,718 points in the month, and the yield curve of U.S. Treasury bonds shifted toward lower yields across all terms (See Chart 7.2).

Chart 7.3
30-Jun-06=100 Evolution of Stock Markets in the World
(World, Latin America and the Merval Index)

Likewise, the economic deceleration observed together with the possible conclusion of the interest rate increase process in the U.S. had its counterpart in commodity markets. Indeed, the prices of major commodities were strongly reduced compared to the previous month, and are below the levels observed at the end of the previous year. The CRB7 commodity futures index contracted by 7.1% in the month, after also falling 5.9% in August. These contractions have already managed to reverse the increase observed since the beginning of the year, and presents a decline of 7.9%.

The Merval index, which groups the most representative shares of the local stock market, contracted 1.5% in the month (see Chart 7.3). Since the beginning of the year, the same index accumulates an increase of 6.1%, while in year-on-year terms it accumulates a decline of 3.4%.

The investment portfolio of the Pension Fund Administrators (AFJP) totaled $77,500 million as of September 15. In the year-over-year comparison, the equity of the AFJP showed an increase of 10% in real terms.

When compared with data from August 15, the pension fund portfolio increased by $1,240 million. On the increases side, there is a notable increase of $842 million in the value of holdings of public securities, as well as an increase of $319 million in the category of securities issued by state entities, and the increase recorded in the lines of stocks and mutual funds for a value of $186 million and $110 million, respectively. On the decreases side, it is interesting to note that fixed-term positions were unwound for $229 million and the value of holdings of foreign securities fell by $121 million. Finally, the variations in other categories were on a net basis $135 million.

**Mutual Funds for Investment**

The equity of the FCI in pesos remained in September at around $12,000 million (see Chart 7.7).

**Variable Income Funds**

**Chart 7.8 - Variable Income Funds Equity and MERVAL Index (in millions $)**

During the month under analysis, the National Securities Commission (CNV) issued a regulation establishing that money market funds must progressively increase the proportion of assets valued at market price in their portfolio and decrease those valued on an accrual basis. The equity of money market funds recorded during the month a decline of approximately $260 million, giving rise to a monthly variation of -6.3%. The profitability of these funds ended September at 6.2%.

On the other hand, the equity of variable income funds during September presented an increase of $495 million (9.7%) (see Chart 7.8). This increase is explained mainly by new subscriptions received by funds that invest in Brazilian stocks, taking advantage of the volatility generated by presidential elections. It is worth noting that during September these funds received investments mainly from the institutional sector (AFJP, ART). The decline in the quotations of assets in the portfolio of variable income funds had a negative impact on their performance, which lost 1.22%.

Finally, the equity of fixed income funds exhibited a negative equity variation of approximately $250 million in September. In the case of funds that hold short-term instruments, the performance during the month was 0.88%, exceeding by 11 basis points that of August; while for funds that hold long-term instruments they were located at 0.83%. On the other hand, the equity of mixed income funds fell $18 million (-6.3%) and its performance was located at 0.24%.
