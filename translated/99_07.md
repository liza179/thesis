# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information
Communication No. 34835

During June, deposits grew on average $270 million (0.3%), and the process of intense dollarization of fixed-term placements that began in mid-May continued. For its part, loans to the non-financial derived sector showed an increase of $140 million.

The international reserves of the financial system experienced a decline, on average, equivalent to 1.8%. Various factors contributed to this result: the lower integration of liquidity requirements by the set of financial entities, the lower demand for circulating currency, the fall in the price of national public securities that make up the BCRA's reserves compared to the quotations from early May, etc.

Domestic interest rates, which had risen in mid-May accompanying sovereign risk, remained at those levels during June, so the average turned out to be slightly higher.

Series of loans from financial entities

For some time now, and as a consequence of the structural changes that the Argentine financial system is showing (privatizations, restructurings, etc.), the statistical series of the total loans of financial entities do not reflect the true situation of credit in the economy. When part or all of the portfolios of entities are transferred to financial trusts, automatically there is a decline in the loans item in the balance sheets of the entities, although those credits remain in effect for the debtors. It should be clarified that an important part of these trusts remain in the possession of the entities, but now within another item in their balance sheet ("Participation in financial trusts"), while another part of these trusts is in the possession of other holders (residual entities, SEDESA, BCRA, etc.).

Currently, preliminary information is available on financial trusts created as a consequence of restructurings of entities in the last two years, so, starting from this report, a special line will appear where the series of loans transferred to these trusts will be added to the series of loans from financial entities, as another indicator to take into account.

International reserves of the BCRA

It is considered appropriate to make some clarifications regarding the interpretation of the figures for net international reserves of the BCRA. With the introduction of the minimum liquidity requirements regime, financial entities have at their disposal a wide range of assets to carry out their integration. In general, two large groups can be differentiated: integration in the BCRA (through repurchase agreement operations), and integration with the foreign correspondent (either as deposits or securities held in custody). Any change in the preferences of financial entities regarding integration in one or the other of these groups results in an increase or decrease in the BCRA's reserves with counterpart in integration abroad, giving rise to certain volatility in the series. Therefore, the variable subject to monitoring by analysts should be "international reserves of the financial system," while the variable "international reserves of the BCRA" is the appropriate one to monitor the backing of financial liabilities. Nevertheless, an alternative way to track the BCRA's reserves while avoiding the volatility of the series would be to subtract from them the equivalent of reverse repurchase agreements, then considering only the reserves that back monetary liabilities. Private Banks (April 1999)
Regarding private banks, their performance during April 1999 was characterized by debt cancellation—fundamentally with foreign entities—on the part of numerous first-line institutions. This reduction was financed with a realization of assets (both liquidity and short-term loans). The decrease in external funding of private banks responded fundamentally to a decision of policy particular to each institution. On the other hand, the exclusion in April of the financial statements of Banco Mendoza S.A., determined an important decline in numerous line items, in particular, in loans.

The profitability of private banks in April 1999 was higher than that recorded in previous months. In this sense, benefits (annualized) in terms of net equity reached 8.9%; in comparison, the average profitability of the first quarter of 1999 was 4.9%. The gradual recovery of profitability has been obtained through an increase in results from holdings of financial assets and miscellaneous profits, and a decrease in administration expenses. Nevertheless, these effects are mitigated by a decrease in the intermediation margin and an increase in charges for uncollectibility.

The delinquency of the credit portfolio of private banks registered a new increase in April 1999. In this sense, the irregular portfolio net of provisions in terms of financing went from 2.3% in March to 2.4%. During April, both the commercial portfolio and the consumption portfolio showed important increases in delinquency. In any case, almost all indicators of uncollectibility continue to show levels lower than those recorded in December 1997.

The integration of capital in terms of assets weighted by risk according to the Basel criterion showed a slight decline, but continued to be maintained at a level (20.9%) much higher than required by local regulations and internationally recommended.
