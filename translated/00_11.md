## Communiqué No. 38908

## Monetary Situation (month of October)

Although the average figures for October show increases in deposits, loans and international reserves, it should be
noted that considering the variations between end-of-month, the data is not as encouraging.

In the case of deposits, the positive variation of $400 million (6% annualized) is explained by the sharp increase
in the last days of September in public sector deposits, and, to a lesser extent, by private sector time deposits,
which generated an important "drag" effect on October's average data. During the month under analysis, the
dollarization of private deposits intensified, reaching 65.6%, and if exclusively time deposits are considered, the
participation of those denominated in dollars reached 79%.

The international reserves of the financial system, which are in part a reflection of the policy of integration of
liquidity requirements of the entities, showed very high levels in the first half of October—a historical maximum
was reached—decreasing in the second half, which resulted in an average increase of US$290 million.

For its part, loans to the private sector increased on average $450 million, led by the performance of
commercial lines and those corresponding to mortgage loans.

Accompanying the increase in sovereign risk, domestic interest rates increased throughout October,
ending around 2 and 1 percentage points higher than the end of the previous month in the segment of
operations in pesos and dollars, respectively.

## Private Banks (data as of August 2000) (1)

During August, the total assets of private banks increased 1.7%, basically due to the effect of the increase
in the item "Other credits from financial intermediation" (5.8%). On the liabilities side, negotiable obligations
decreased 3.4% and loan lines from abroad increased 2.0%.

In August 2000, private banks recorded profits equivalent to 5.1% of net equity in annualized terms. The main
differences with the previous month are due to the increase in charges for uncollectible accounts, partially
offset by the increase in results from services and the decline in income tax accrued.

The evolution of the quality of the credit portfolio was conditioned by the increase in irregular portfolio of an
important private bank during August. Consequently, the irregular portfolio in terms of financings for all private
banks went from 7.9% to 8.3%. The coverage indicators worsened; thus, the irregular portfolio net of provisions
in terms of financings went from 2.0% to 2.4%. For its part, credit risk, measured as the irregular portfolio net
of provisions in terms of net equity, increased from 9.8% to 11.6%.

The total capital requirement of private banks fell $80 million (1.0%) in the month of August 2000, explained
basically by the decline in the credit risk requirement, which in turn decreases due to the decline in holdings
of risk assets. The integration of capital increased $60 million (0.5%), due to the increase in complementary
net equity. The evolution of the requirement and integration resulted in an increase in the total excess of capital
integration, which in terms of total requirement went from 50.3% to 52.6%. Due to not yet having complete
information on risk-weighted assets referring to holdings in investment accounts and financings to the public
sector, the table on private banks does not include these in the row of "Risk-weighted assets."

Tables are attached with the evolution of the main variables.
