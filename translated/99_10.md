# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information
 Communication No. 35649

During September deposits experienced an increase, which on average reached $40 million, and accumulated growth of 5.9% over the last 12 months. It is worth highlighting that greater momentum was noted starting in the second half of the month, so that if the increase between end of September and end of August is considered, annualized growth would reach 12%. A significant increase in dollar deposits was likewise observed while those denominated in pesos evidenced a decline. The dollarization of time deposits reached 75%. Associated with lower demand for cash in circulation, the international reserves of the financial system suffered a decline on average in September compared to the average of the previous month.

Loans (including those that became part of financial trusts) evidenced an increase on average of $360 million and accumulated growth of 6% over the last 12 months. It is worth noting that the statistical series of loans to the private sector shows a decline in August that is due, in part, to the establishment of a new financial trust¹. Interest rates increased during September, which contrasts with the decline observed in country risk indicators.

Private Banks (July 1999)

No substantial changes were observed in the main equity variables of private banks during July 1999. The decline observed in available funds and public securities ($900 million) was due to a change in the composition of liquidity requirement integration: part of deposits with the international custodian and repurchase agreements against delivery of public securities with the BCRA were substituted with repurchase agreements against delivery of deposit certificates with the BCRA, which are reflected in the item "Other credits from financial intermediation". On the other hand, increases were observed in loans to the public sector and to the financial sector, of $200 million in each case. Likewise, the total volume of repurchase agreement operations, forward and spot sale-purchase of financial assets increased considerably, which explains the significant increases recorded by other credits and other obligations from financial intermediation.

The profitability of private banks remained positive in July, standing at 2.9% (annualized) of net equity. These profits are lower than those recorded on average during the first semester. The factors that explain the decline in profitability are lower income from holding financial assets, lower miscellaneous profits, and higher provisions for loan losses. Nevertheless, despite the stagnation of the financial system, a clear downward trend in operating costs continues to be observed.

The delinquency of the credit portfolio of private banks showed an increase in July, moving from 7.2% to 7.4% in terms of financing. For its part, the irregular portfolio net of provisions in terms of financing continues to register a level of 2.5% since April 1999.

The solvency indicators of private banks remain relatively constant. In particular, the integration of capital for credit risk in terms of risk-weighted assets according to the Basel criterion stood at 17.8%, that is, more than double what is recommended internationally.

Tables with the evolution of the main variables are attached.

¹As noted on previous occasions, loans going to financial trusts are excluded from the "Loans" item of financial entities, so they do not appear in the statistical series of loans. MONTHLY MONETARY AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION

(1) At 30 days.
(2) Corresponds to fixed-term deposits for amounts of one million pesos or more. Between September and December 1998, the interest rate corresponds to deposits agreed between 30 and 59 days; from January 1999 onwards, for deposits between 30 and 35 days.
(3) The Banks Index is a capitalization index constructed with the same methodology as Burcap. It includes shares of the banks: Galicia, Francés, Bansud, Supervielle, Suquía, Hipotecario and Río de la Plata.
(4) The sovereign risk premium is measured as the difference between the returns of the FRB and a U.S. government bond of equal duration.
(5) Currency risk is measured as the difference between the return on Consolidation Bonds (BOCONES) Pro1 in pesos and Pro 2 in dollars, which allow for separating the exposure of the local currency by having similar duration and interest rate risk, and identical sovereign risk.
