Monetary Report | October 2013 | BCRA | 21. Summary1
• Since mid-2013, monetary aggregates have maintained a stable year-on-year expansion rate. In October, the broadest monetary aggregate in pesos (M3) showed a year-on-year growth of 29.6%, presenting a monthly increase of 1.9%. For its part, the broadest private monetary aggregate (private M3) exhibited a variation of 31.5% over the last 12 months, with a monthly increase identical to that registered by total M3 (1.9% in October). The monthly increase of the broadest aggregates was explained, during the month of October, by the dynamics of credit to the private sector and by operations of the public sector. Considering the first ten months of 2013, and as a consequence of active public policies aimed at promoting productive credit, loans in pesos to the private sector proved to be the main driving factor of private M3.

• Among the components of private M3, the behavior of fixed-term placements stands out, which continued maintaining a high year-on-year expansion rate, which is currently situated close to 40%. In October, fixed-term deposits increased 2.3% and, in this way, continued gaining participation within private M3, reaching a weight of 31.1%; 4.3 percentage points above the proportion they represented 2 years ago. Distinguishing by amount bracket, in the month both deposits of less than $1 million (2.4%) and placements belonging to the wholesale segment (2.2%) increased.

• Banking liquidity (measured as the sum of cash in banks, the current account of entities in the Central Bank, net repos with that entity and holdings of LEBAC and NOBAC, as a percentage of total deposits in pesos) was situated at 31.8%. Compared to September, a reduction is observed in the proportion of net repos with the Central Bank, partially offset by the increase in LEBAC and NOBAC holdings in terms of deposits. Meanwhile, the most liquid assets (cash in banks and current account at the Central Bank) remained stable in terms of deposits.

• During the month of October, loans in pesos to the private sector exhibited a monthly increase of 2.7% ($11,540 million), in line with the growth levels they have been showing since May. The main contributions to the month's growth were made by financings instrumented through documents and by personal loans, which contributed 1 percentage point and 0.8 percentage points, respectively.

• Within the framework of policies to stimulate productive credit developed by the BCRA, disbursements of funds awarded through auctions of the Bicentennial Productive Financing Program (PFPB) continued. Thus, the total funds disbursed since the beginning of the PFPB amounts to $5,745 million, which represents around 75% of the total amount awarded.

• Additionally, with the completion of the third stage of the "Credit Line for Productive Investment" by the end of the year, loans of almost $55,000 million will have been granted through this modality. These initiatives allowed loans to SMEs to gain participation in the total of loans to companies. In effect, the dynamism that financing to SMEs has been showing allowed them to reach a participation close to 31% of loans to legal entities, exceeding by 8 percentage points the values at the end of 2009. It is noteworthy that 6 percentage points of that increase took place since the implementation of the "Credit Line for Productive Investment" in mid-2012.

• With regard to passive interest rates, the rate paid by private banks for their fixed-term deposits in pesos up to $100 thousand and up to 35 days of term averaged 15.7%, while the BADLAR of private banks – interest rate for deposits of $1 million and more, 30-35 days of term – registered a monthly average of 18.7%. For its part, among active interest rates, the rate charged by advances granted...
two to companies, for more than $10 million and up to 7 days maturity, also averaged October at 18.7%.

The phrase "dos a empresas" (two to companies) seems incomplete or may be part of a longer sentence that was cut off during PDF parsing. The complete context would help provide a more accurate translation of what "dos a empresas" refers to (possibly "tasas a empresas" - rates to companies, or similar).

Finally, the broadest monetary aggregate (M3*), which includes cash in the hands of the public, cancellatory checks, CEDINs and the total of deposits in pesos and foreign currency (expressed in pesos), showed a growth of 2.1%, accumulating a year-on-year variation of 28.7%.

## 3. Bank Liquidity¹

In October, bank liquidity in pesos (measured as the sum of cash in banks, the current account of entities in the Central Bank, net repos with such entity and the holding of LEBACs and NOBACs, as a percentage of total deposits in pesos) stood at 31.8% (0.2 p.p. below September, see Graph 3.1). This variation was explained by a reduction in the proportion of net repos with the Central Bank, partially offset by the increase in LEBACs and NOBACs holdings in terms of deposits. Meanwhile, the most liquid assets (cash in banks and current account in the Central Bank) remained stable in terms of deposits. For its part, the Minimum Cash position was in surplus for a value equivalent to 0.2% of deposits, in line with what was registered in recent months.

Meanwhile, liquidity in the foreign currency segment continued at elevated levels, increasing by 3.2 p.p. with respect to September and standing at a level equivalent to 118.5% of deposits in foreign currency.

## 4. Loans¹⁴⁵

In October, loans in pesos to the private sector showed an increase of 2.7% ($11,540 million), in line with the growth levels that have been shown since May (see Graph 4.1). The main contributions to the month's growth are explained by financing instruments through documents and personal loans, which contributed 1 p.p. and 0.8 p.p., respectively.

Within loans intended primarily to finance commercial activities, advances increased 0.6% in the month ($380 million). In year-on-year terms, they accelerated their expansion rate, with a growth rate of 30.7%, almost 2 p.p. more than in September (see Graph 4.2). For its part, financing instruments through documents registered an increase of 4.1% in the month ($4,060 million). Its rate...

⁴ Monthly variations in loans are adjusted for accounting movements, fundamentally caused by transfers of credits in the portfolio of entities to financial trusts.

⁵ In this report, "amounts granted" or "new loans" are understood to be loans (new and renewals) concluded in a period. In contrast, the variation in balance consists of loans concluded, minus amortizations and cancellations of the period.

# Advances in Pesos to the Private Sector

The rate of year-on-year variation remained at historically elevated levels, close to 50% (see Chart 4.3).

It should be noted that, within the framework of productive credit stimulus policies developed by the BCRA, funds adjudicated through the auctions of the Bicentennial Productive Financing Program (PFPB) continued to be disbursed. Thus, the total funds disbursed since the beginning of the PFPB amounts to $5,745 million, which represents approximately 75% of the adjudicated amount. Additionally, with the completion of the third stage of the "Credit Line for Productive Investment," by year-end loans totaling almost $55,000 million will have been granted through this initiative.

The credit lines aimed mainly at financing family consumption also showed growth in October. Personal loans accelerated their expansion rate and registered an increase of 3.6% in the month ($3,310 million). Thus, their year-on-year variation stood at around 32%, 1.2 percentage points above that of the previous month. Regarding the amount granted (new loans) through personal loans, it amounted to $6,300 million, a level similar to that of the previous month. Regarding the destination of these resources, the acquisition of appliances and household items continued to stand out, along with the repair or construction of real estate, which represented 17.2% and 17.6% of the total, respectively (see Chart 4.4). In order of importance, they were followed by refinancing or cancellation of liabilities with 10% and the acquisition of automobiles for personal use with 7.8%. Some destinations were also identified that are linked to productive activity rather than consumption, such as those referring to "acquisition of automobiles for other uses" and "acquisition of machinery, equipment and tools," which together represented 4% of the total. Finally, it should be noted that the category "Other destinations" concentrated the largest portion of resources (41.3% of the total), grouping under it a diversity of fund uses that, as a consequence of their minimal relative weight, were not categorized individually.

For their part, credit card financing grew 3.1% ($2,170 million), accumulating a year-on-year variation above 40%.

Regarding loans with real collateral, pledged loans showed good performance, presenting growth of 3.4% ($980 million), the highest of the last four months. Thus, their year-on-year variation continued to hover around 46%. Meanwhile, mortgage loans grew 1.4% ($560 million),

The average daily operating volume increased by $240 million, reaching $4,890 million. The increase was driven by operations in the REPO trading session (excluding operations in which the BCRA participates), in which the average daily operating volume in the month stood at $3,030 million. Meanwhile, in the call market, the amount traded decreased slightly and stood at $1,860 million. With respect to the net position recorded in the call market, foreign entities once again proved to be the only net borrowers of funds, while the rest of the entities were net lenders.

**Passive Interest Rates¹**

The interest rates paid by financial entities to depositors recorded slight increases in October. The weighted average of interest rates on new fixed-term operations in pesos averaged 16%, showing a monthly increase of 0.5 p.p..

For its part, in the retail segment, the weighted average of interest rates paid by private banks on their fixed-term deposits in pesos up to $100 thousand and up to 35 days of term averaged 15.7%, registering an increase of 0.5 p.p. in the month. Meanwhile, in the wholesale segment, the BADLAR of private banks – interest rate for deposits of $1 million and more of 30-35 days of term – exhibited a monthly increase of 0.7 p.p., averaging 18.7% (see Chart 5.6).

**Active Interest Rates¹⁹**

Among commercial lines, the interest rate on overdrafts averaged 25%. In particular, the interest rate corresponding to overdrafts granted to companies, for more than $10 million and up to 7 days of term, stood at 18.7%, registering a monthly increase of 1.3 p.p..

For its part, among financing implemented through documents, the monthly average of the interest rate on documents at sole signature stood at 21.1%, with a monthly increase of 0.4 p.p.. Similarly, the monthly average of the interest rate corresponding to document discounting moved to stand at 22.8%.

**Rate Corridor**

Among longer-term loans, the monthly average of the interest rate on personal loans stood at 38.2%. Meanwhile, among loans with real guarantees, the interest rate on those granted with pledge guarantee averaged 22.4% while the monthly average of the interest rate on mortgage loans intended for individuals stood at 16.3%.

In the exchange market, the peso depreciated against the US dollar, at a slower pace than observed in the previous month. Likewise, the peso also registered depreciation in relation to the euro and the real. The average quotations for October were 5.85 $/US$, and 7.98 $/euro and 2.67 $/real, which represented a variation with respect to September of 2%, 4.1% and 5.4%, respectively (see Chart 6.1). For its part, in the futures market (ROFEX), no significant change was observed in expectations for the remainder of the year, registering a slight increase in the exchange rate expected for the first months of next year. The average daily amount traded in October was close to $1,200 million, lower by one third compared to September, when a historical maximum amount was recorded.

7. Main Policy Measures of Other Central Banks

During October, and as in the previous month, the main central banks¹⁰ maintained the bias of their respective monetary policies unchanged. Only some slight adjustments were recorded, mainly in emerging countries.

However, two moments in the month stood out with considerable impact on the markets. In the first days of the month, the monetary authorities of the European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of England (BoE) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) met, and decided to keep their monetary policies unchanged. In this way, the ECB maintained its policy interest rate

 worse economic indicators, the ECB reduced its monetary policy interest rate to a historic minimum
 of 0.25%. It also reduced the width of the interest rate corridor by lowering the credit facility interest rate
 to 0.75% and maintaining at 0% the interest rate of the deposit facility. Along with this, the ECB decided
 to extend the conditions of full allotment and fixed interest rate for its regular operations of liquidity provision, whatever is necessary, and at least

 fixed-income funds grew $2,800 million (10%) and
 explained the majority of the expansion (see Chart

 onded by the increase in the valuation of the portfolio
 assets, contributed positively to the monthly perfor-
