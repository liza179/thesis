 The statistical closing of this report was on September 6, 2016. All figures are provisional
 and subject to revision.

1. Summary¹
• The consumer price indices published in August confirmed that the disinflation process continued in July. The general level of prices at the national level increased on average by 2% during said month2. Going forward, the volatility associated with corrections in regulated prices on the general level of price indices will make it more relevant to focus attention on the evolution of the core component of the same. In July, all core inflation indicators showed monthly deceleration.

• The different indicators followed by the BCRA indicate that in August the deceleration of inflation continued, even without considering the effect of the reversal in the increases in regulated prices. In turn, the published surveys indicate that inflation expectations for the last quarter of the year remain very close to the BCRA's objective for that period.

• Taking into account all this information, during the course of August the BCRA decreased the interest rate on 35-day LEBACs by a total of 2 p.p., bringing it to 28.25% at the end of the month. The interest rates on its passive and active repo operations were reduced by the same magnitude and at the end of August were located at 24%-33% and 25%-34%, for the 1-day and 7-day segments, respectively. In the first week of September the BCRA lowered an additional 0.5 p.p. its reference interest rate, leaving it at 27.75%; it reduced the rates on repo operations by the same measure. The BCRA will continue to maintain a clear anti-inflationary bias to ensure that the disinflation process continues toward its objective for this year of a monthly inflation of 1.5% or less in the last quarter. Likewise, the monetary authority will conduct its decisions accentuating the focus on medium-term expectations, especially those for 2017, in view of the lags presented by the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy.

• The shortest-term interest rates – mainly those traded in the interfinancial markets and those applied to loans granted through advances of up to 7 days – of the money market remained within the corridor of interest rates established by the Central Bank in the repo market. On the other hand, the interest rates paid on fixed-term deposits in pesos maintained a downward trend during the course of the month.

• The monetary base decelerated its year-on-year growth, since the expansion associated with foreign exchange purchases and operations with the public sector were almost completely sterilized through LEBAC placements. In turn, the broader monetary aggregates continued moderating their expansion rate, as has been occurring throughout 2016 so far.

• Loans in pesos to the private sector continued showing limited growth, which in August reached 0.6%. In contrast, financing in dollars continued displaying outstanding dynamism and in August increased 8.9% (US$590 million), totaling for the year so far an increase of 148% (US$4,310 million). Thus, the average balance for the month exceeded US$7,000 million. The growing trend shown by these loans is explained by the behavior of unsecured documents, a line strongly associated with foreign trade.

• Deposits in pesos decreased in the month, driven by placements by the public sector. In contrast, deposits in pesos from the private sector increased, mainly due to placements on terms from the retail segment (of less than $1 million), which in August reached year-on-year growth of 52%.

## Monthly Inflation - General Levels

**Cities shown:** Ciudad de Buenos Aires, San Luis, INDEC, Córdoba, Mendoza

The price indices published during August confirmed that the disinflation process continued in July (see Graph 2.1). At the national level, consumer prices increased on average by 2% in that month. The volatility generated by corrections in regulated prices on the general level of price indices will make it even more relevant to focus attention on the evolution of the core component of the same. In that regard, all known public core inflation indicators showed a deceleration of this component in July (see Graph 2.2).

For August, the various indicators followed by the BCRA indicate that the deceleration of inflation continued, still without considering the effect of the reversal in the increases of regulated prices. On the other hand, the different surveys published indicate that inflation expectations for the last quarter of the year remain very close to the BCRA's objective for that period.

Considering all this information, during August the BCRA reduced the interest rate on the 35-day LEBAC by a total of 2 percentage points, bringing it to 28.25% at the end of the month. Before the publication of this report, in the first auction of September an additional reduction of 0.5 percentage points was made, bringing this interest rate to 27.75%.

In the primary market, the interest rates on LEBAC with longer maturities experienced smaller declines than those exhibited by shorter-term securities, which generated a flatter yield curve slope. In the last auction of the month, the cut-off rate for the 252-day LEBAC was placed at 25.6%, 1.4 percentage points below its level at the end of July (see Graph 2.3).

Meanwhile, the Central Bank continued operating actively in the secondary market in order to induce a convergence of observed yields within a corridor of +/- 0.5 percentage points with respect to the monetary policy rate. Operations were carried out with the 35-day security, with sales in the month totaling approximately VN$40,600 million (see Graph 2.4).

In a manner compatible with what was provided for the 35-day LEBAC interest rate, in August the Central Bank decided to reduce the interest rates on its pass operations by a total of 2 percentage points, both for 1-day operations and for 7-day operations. In this way, at the end of August the interest rates for passive and active pass operations of 1 day were placed at 24%-33% and those corresponding to 7-day passes at 25%-34%, respectively. These interest rates were also reduced by an additional 0.5 percentage points in the first auction of September.

 Interest Rates in the Market

 Short-term interest rates showed downward
 Chart 2.5 trajectories, remaining within the interest rate corridor
 established by the Central Bank in the over-the-counter
 market (see Chart 2.5).

 In the interbank markets, the interest rate for
 call operations at 1 business day averaged 28.3% in
 August, a level 0.7 p.p. lower than the value
 registered the previous month. The average interest rate for operations
 at 1 business day among financial entities in the guaranteed
 market (REPO wheel) stood at 27.7%, exhibiting
 a decrease of 0.6 p.p. The average daily amount
 negotiated in both markets remained around
 $11,100 million.

 Active interest rates intended mainly for
 financing families showed dissimilar
 behaviors. While the average interest rate
 for personal loans stood at 42.4%, remaining
 practically stable with respect to July; the
 corresponding rate for mortgage loans averaged

In this report, "amounts granted" or "new loans" is understood as loans (new and renewals) arranged in a period. In contrast, the variation in balance is composed of the loans arranged, minus amortizations and cancellations of the period.

Source: BCRA 5. Liquidity of Financial Enti-
ties¹
During August, the trend recorded in recent months was reversed, as a decline in deposits was registered (explained by the behavior of public sector deposits; see Monetary Aggregates section) while loans showed moderate growth. This behavior implied that the broad liquidity ratio in local currency (sum of cash in banks, the current account of entities at the Central Bank, net repos with such entity and the holding of LEBAC and NOBAC as a percentage of deposits in pesos) decreased slightly to 42% (see Graph 5.1), 0.3 p.p. lower than the maximum recorded the previous month. In this context, financial entities ended the month with a surplus in the Minimum Cash position equivalent to 0.2% of total deposits in pesos.

For its part, in the foreign currency segment, the strong growth of loans in dollars continued, which exceeded the increase in total deposits. These factors contributed to the liquidity ratio in foreign currency (sum of cash in banks, the current account of entities at the Central Bank, net repos with such entity and the holding of LEBAC in foreign currency, as a percentage of deposits in dollars) continuing to decrease to 75.8%, 4.5 p.p. below that observed the previous month.

**6. International Reserves and Foreign Exchange Market**

In August, international reserves decreased by US$1,362 million, ending the period at US$31,150 million (see Graph 6.1). The reduction was reflected in a decline in foreign currency current accounts of entities at the BCRA, originated by various reasons: repayment of external debt by the entities themselves; granting of local credits in dollars (see Loans section), placement of National Treasury debt in the local market, which the latter subsequently used to face its dollar maturities; and also a decrease in foreign currency holdings of entities to supply the foreign exchange market.

On the other hand, it is worth mentioning that the Ministry of Finance and Public Finances issued a non-transferable National Treasury Bill for US$376 million, which was subscribed by the BCRA, in order to cancel 25% of the increase in the quota of the Argentine Republic in the International Monetary Fund¹⁰. It is worth noting that this operation only generates a qualitative change in the BCRA's assets, given that Special Drawing Rights (SDR) as a result of such placement will be deposited in the BCRA for an equivalent amount, being considered international reserve assets.

 of other central banks

 During the month of August there were few developments
 regarding measures by other central banks. The most
 Chart 7.2 relevant was the decision of the English monetary
 Dollar per Pound authority to resort to a new set of expansionary measures
 2.8 following the referendum in which the United Kingdom
 2.6 decided to leave the European Union (Brexit)12.
 2.4
 2.2 In effect, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of
 2.0 the Bank of England (BoE) surprised the market with
 1.8 a set of three expansionary measures, which went
 1.6 beyond what private analysts anticipated. First, it
 1.4 reduced its monetary policy interest rate (the Bank
 1.2 Rate) for the first time since February 2009, and did
 1.0 so by 0.25 p.p., bringing it to 0.25% (see Chart 7.1).

Source: BCRA based on Bloomberg Along with this, it increased the amount and expanded
 the scope of its asset purchase program. This program
 went from £375,000 million to £445,000 million.
 Additionally, within its quantitative easing program, the
 MPC decided to launch a new funding scheme - the
 Term Funding Scheme (TFS) - which aims to provide
 liquidity to financial entities at an interest rate close to
 the Bank Rate in order to facilitate the pass-through
 of the monetary policy interest rate reduction to the
