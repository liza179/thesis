# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information

## Monetary Situation (January 2000)

During January, deposits registered an increase of 3% (approximately $2,200 million), although on average they maintained the level of the previous month. The increase observed occurred across the different types of deposits in proportions similar to the decline observed in December; therefore they reached the levels that they presented at the end of November.

Loans granted by financial entities experienced a slight increase (0.4%), driven by the increase in those directed to the public sector.

On the other hand, a decline was verified in the average integration of liquidity requirements by financial entities. This lower integration was associated with the BCRA's policies of flexibility in some regulations, to address the possible effects of the so-called "year 2000 problem". In this sense, the existence of a two-month position December 1999-January 2000 allowed entities to maintain an excess integration in the first month, and basically utilize in January the facilities granted by this institution. In turn, the lower integration of liquidity requirements influenced the evolution of the international reserves of the financial system, which, considering average figures, showed a decrease of 1.8% during the first month of the year.

Interest rates, in general, decreased compared to the previous month (the decline was 1.5 percentage points in the case of loans between entities and more than 3 percentage points in the case of time deposits in pesos for amounts exceeding one million). Likewise, a reduction was observed in the spread between interest rates negotiated for operations in pesos and those negotiated for operations in dollars (from 3 to 1 percentage point in the case of 30-day deposits for amounts exceeding one million).

## Private Banks (November 1999)

Between October and November 1999, the total assets of private banks showed no variations. The sharp declines recorded in available funds and public securities are due to the fact that entities substituted, in the concept of integration of liquidity requirements, deposits with the international custodian ($800 million) and repurchase agreements of public securities with the BCRA ($600 million), for repurchase agreements of deposit certificates with the BCRA, which are recorded in the "Other Credits for Financial Intermediation" item. Nevertheless, total liquidity verified a slight decline of $160 million (0.8%).

During November, loans grew $360 million (1%), mainly due to the increase in loans granted to the public sector ($270 million, that is, 5%). On the side of fund capture, deposits grew $560 million (1%), while a slight decrease was recorded in external funding: negotiable obligations fell $130 million (4%) and external credit lines decreased $150 million (2%).

Private banks incurred losses in November: 1.9% of net equity, on an annualized basis. The fundamental cause of these losses was a lower margin on interest and services. Likewise, charges for uncollectibility remained at an elevated level, while miscellaneous income again recorded low earnings. On the other hand, these effects were partially softened by a significantly lower charge for income tax.

During November, private banks again registered a decline in the delinquency of their credit portfolio. In particular, the irregular portfolio in terms of financing went from 7.4% to 7.3%, while the irregular portfolio net of provisions in terms of financing went from 2.5% to 2.3%. For its part, the indicator of equity exposure to default risk (irregular portfolio net of provisions in terms of net equity) also verified an important decline, going from 13.8% to 13.2%.
The changes in the composition of private banks' assets determined a decline in the requirement for credit risk and interest rate (1.6%). This decrease implied a growth in excess total capital integration (0.6%). For its part, capital integration in terms of assets weighted by risk calculated according to the Basel criteria, again showed a slight increase, reaching 17.8%.
