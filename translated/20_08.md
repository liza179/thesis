## 1. Summary

In August, the broad monetary aggregate M3 private recorded, in nominal terms and without seasonality, an increase of 3.2%, the smallest of the last nine months, while in real terms it remained practically at the same level as in July. Within it, the positive contribution of time deposits was offset by a negative contribution of sight deposits, while the contribution of currency in circulation held by the public was almost neutral. In terms of GDP, the monetary aggregates showed a change in trend starting in July, beginning to reverse the strong monetization process observed in the first half of the year.

The growth of time deposits was similar to that of the previous month, with monthly variations that continue to be among the highest since the end of convertibility. In nominal terms, they completed an average monthly increase of 8%, equivalent to growth of 4.8% in real terms. The growth of the month was composed of both placements of more than $1 million and those of less than $1 million, the latter encouraged by the increase in the minimum interest rate set from August onwards.

The new minimum interest rate for fixed-term deposits in pesos of natural persons for an amount of up to $1 million was set from the beginning of the month at 87% of the LELIQ rate, increasing to 33.06% n.a. (38.57% a.a.). Additionally, the coefficient that determines the fixed rate of early cancellation of deposits with the option of early cancellation in UVA was raised to 0.75, with said interest rate moving from a level of 26.6% to 28.5%. In this way, the BCRA continues to advance with its policy of protection of savings in pesos.

In nominal terms and without seasonality, loans in pesos to the private sector registered a monthly expansion of 4.1%. In real terms, the expansion was 1.0%, equal to that observed in July. The growth of the month was explained by the behavior of credit cards and financing instruments through documents.

Among the lines promoted by the BCRA during the economic emergency, the line for SMEs and Health Service Providers stands out. It accumulated, at the close of August, disbursements of $410,353 million, practically doubling the $220,000 million originally expected. When all the lines created to mitigate the effects of the economic emergency are added together, as of August they represent slightly more than 40% of the total commercial loans.
Complementing the measures already adopted to alleviate the financial burden on families, the BCRA
established that unpaid balances corresponding to credit card financing whose due dates fall during the
month of September will be automatically refinanced over a minimum term of 12 months, with 3 months of
grace in 9 equal and consecutive monthly installments, at a maximum interest rate of 40% nominal annual.

Monthly Monetary Report | August 2020 | BCRA | 32. Monetary Aggregates

In August, the broad monetary aggregate M3 private¹ registered, in nominal terms and without seasonality,
an increase of 3.2%, the smallest of the last nine months, while in real terms it remained practically at the
same level as July². Within it, the positive contribution of time deposits was offset by a negative contribution
of demand deposits, while the contribution of currency in circulation was almost neutral (see Graph 2.1). In terms
of GDP, the monetary aggregates showed a change in trend as of July, beginning to reverse the strong monetization
process observed in the first half of the year (see Graph 2.2).

(monthly variation and contribution by component to growth)    (series adjusted for seasonality)

The growth of time deposits was similar to that of the previous month, with monthly variations that
continue to be among the highest since the end of convertibility (see Graph 2.3). In nominal terms, they
completed an average monthly increase of 8%, equivalent to a real growth of 4.8%. The month's growth was
composed of both placements of more than $1 million and those of less than $1 million, the latter encouraged
by the increase in the minimum interest rate established as of August (see Section "Interest Rates"). Distinguishing
by type of deposit, it is verified that the boost came again from peso deposits, while placements denominated in
UVA (both traditional ones and those with early cancellation options) continued declining, in a context of
inflation deceleration. For its part, the average balance of time placements linked to the dollar exchange rate
(DIVA) continued growing, although its contribution to total deposit growth remained minimal (see Graph 2.4).
Thus, in the last twelve months time deposits accumulated nominal growth close to 62%. In real terms, the
year-on-year rate of change moved into positive territory as of June, reaching 12.7% in August.

¹ Includes currency in circulation and peso deposits of the non-financial private sector.
² All real variables were deflated by the Core inflation expectations of the REM for August, corresponding to that month's survey.

Regarding means of payment (private M2), cash in circulation held by the public showed a monthly variation of 3.7% in nominal terms and without seasonality, which is equivalent to an increase of 0.7% at constant prices. Said variation was placed slightly below that of July and turned out to be significantly lower than the average growth of the April to June period (9.3% at current prices and 7.3% at constant prices). For its part, sight deposits registered a decrease of 0.4% in nominal terms and adjusted for seasonality (3.3% in real terms), after eight consecutive months of growth. In this way, private M2 continued to decelerate its expansion rate, following the record growth in April. In August, it posted an increase of 1% in nominal terms and without seasonality, which implied a decrease of 2% in real terms (see Chart 2.5).

In the dollar segment, the balance of deposits from the private sector reached US$17,160 million at the end of August, registering an increase of US$180 million compared to the close of July. The increase was concentrated in placements in savings accounts of individuals from lower income strata (up to US$10,000).

(monthly variation. Real without seasonality)       (variation of monthly average balance)

Finally, the Monetary Base presented, in nominal terms, an average monthly increase of $25,670 million (1.1%). This implies a decrease of 1.8% in real terms (see Chart 2.6). The expansion associated with the public sector (fundamentally through transitory advances) was significantly lower than in previous months and was partially offset by the contractionary effect generated by net sales of foreign currency to the private sector and absorption through reverse repos and LELIQ. From the demand side, the increase was concentrated in cash in circulation held by the public, while bank reserves (current account of entities in the BCRA and cash in banks) registered a decrease.

## 3. Loans to the private sector

In nominal terms and without seasonality, loans in pesos to the private sector registered a monthly expansion of 4.1% (see Chart 3.1). In real terms, the expansion was 1.0%, equal to that observed in July. The month's growth was explained by the behavior of credit cards and financing carried out through documents. In this way, loans in pesos to the private sector accumulated between March and August a growth of 30% nominal s.e. (12.9% real) and 52.1% (5.7% real) compared to the same period of the previous year.

Credit card financing showed a nominal expansion of 8.1% s.e. (which is equivalent to an increase of 4.9% real; see Chart 3.2). One of the factors that explained the rise in this financing is the zero-rate credits aimed at self-employed and autonomous individuals. At the close of August, 529,147 loans were granted through this line for a total amount of $62,745 million, with little more than 90% having been credited³. In turn, 379 zero-rate credits were granted aimed at self-employed and autonomous individuals with activities related to culture (with better conditions than credits for other self-employed and autonomous individuals) for a total amount of $41 million⁴. The dynamism presented by "Ahora 12" financing also had a positive impact on credit card performance, particularly in the last days of July due to "Hot sale 2020". For its part, personal loans showed a nominal expansion of 0.7% s.e. in the month, although in real terms it implied a decrease of 2.2% s.e.

(without seasonality; variation of monthly average balance) (without seasonality; variation of monthly average balance)
3 For the accreditation of these funds, 176,756 new cards were issued.
4 These financings have a nominal annual interest rate of 0%, include a grace period of 12 months from their
first accreditation and will be reimbursed starting from the thirteenth month in 12 equal and consecutive monthly installments.

 Monthly Monetary Report | August 2020 | BCRA | 6 Complementing the measures already adopted to alleviate the financial burden on families in the context of
the pandemic, the BCRA provided that unpaid balances corresponding to credit card financings whose maturity dates occur during the month of September will be automatically refinanced for a minimum term of 12 months, with 3 months of grace in 9 equal and consecutive monthly installments, at a maximum interest rate of 40% nominal annual. It should be clarified that the unpaid balance may be paid off early in full or in part, at any time and at no cost, except for the compensatory interest accrued until the moment of payment5.

After several months of deceleration, following having reached a peak in April, productive financing regained momentum. In August, lines with mostly commercial destination registered an expansion of 4.3% monthly in nominal terms and without seasonality. Thus, they were positioned 126.2% above the value recorded in the same month of the previous year (57.2% at constant prices). Within this type of financings, single signature documents continued to be the main vehicle through which credit was channeled, while gradual growth continued to be observed in the balance of discounted documents (see Chart 3.3). Meanwhile, current account advances stabilized, although below the average level of July.

Among the commercial lines, those promoted by the BCRA in the framework of the health emergency stand out. The working capital line for SMEs and Health Service Providers accumulated by the last day of August disbursements of $410,353 million, practically doubling the $220,000 million originally expected. Approximately 98% of the total disbursed corresponded to financings to SMEs, whose dynamism came from credits intended for working capital (excluding salaries and bad check coverage) and deferred check coverage, both financings maintained a practically constant growth rate in recent months (see Chart 3.4).

 Monthly Monetary Report | August 2020 | BCRA | 7 On the other hand, through the SME Plus line, intended for companies without bank financing, $2,765 million were granted by the end of August (in addition, $89 million are approved but not yet disbursed). The number of companies that accessed this line amounted to 5,583, of which 4,461 did so with FOGAR guarantees.

It is worth noting that in August, the subsidized rate financing lines included within the fourth tranche of the "Emergency Assistance Program for Employment and Production" (ATP) began to be granted. These lines were intended for the payment of salaries for companies with up to 800 employees, whose billing had experienced year-over-year growth between 0% and 30% as of June (at a tiered rate with a maximum of 15% n.a.). By the last day of August, $589 million were granted, which reached 30,199 workers. Recently, with the fifth tranche of the ATP, it was established that credit will be available for companies that registered year-over-year billing growth of between 0% and 40% as of July, at a single rate of 15% n.a. Furthermore, it was established that those companies that maintained or increased the number of workers compared to pre-pandemic levels will be able to convert the credit into a subsidy.
In any case, considering the totality of the credit lines to companies created to mitigate the effects of the economic emergency, as of August they represent something more than 40% of the total commercial loans.

Regarding credit lines with real collateral, pledge loans presented in August a monthly increase of 6.8% in nominal terms and without seasonality, the third positive variation after 21 consecutive months without expansions (-4.6% y-o-y; see Chart 3.5). In real terms, the expansion was 3.7%, the largest increase since mid-2017, with a decline of 33.8% in year-on-year terms. The growth of pledge loans is linked to a certain recovery in vehicle registration levels. On the other hand, mortgage financing maintained zero growth, both in monthly and year-on-year terms. Unlike what occurred with automobiles, this market remains with very few transactions.

Finally, loans in foreign currency to the private sector continued declining. The monthly decline was 7.3% (US$509 million), accumulating a contraction of 60% compared to last July (the last maximum of the series). This contraction of loans in dollars continued responding almost entirely to what occurred with unsecured promissory notes.

Monthly Monetary Report | August 2020 | BCRA | 84. Liquidity of financial entities

During August, broad banking liquidity in local currency (includes current accounts at the BCRA, cash in banks, balances of transactions arranged with the BCRA, holdings of LELIQ, bonds eligible for reserve requirements integration and NOCOM) remained practically stable at an average of 65% of deposits. Thus, it continues to be located at historically elevated levels (see chart 4.1).

In terms of liquidity composition, the stock of LELIQ as a percentage of deposits registered an increase of 1.1 p.p., explained by LELIQ used for the integration of minimum cash, as a result of greater growth of fixed-term deposits over sight deposits. As a counterpart, current accounts at the BCRA reduced their participation, as did net transactions with the BCRA (by 0.5 p.p. and 1 p.p. of deposits, respectively). Meanwhile, integration with National Treasury Bonds registered an increase of 0.4 p.p. within the framework of the auction of said bonds conducted at the end of July. For its part, cash in banks remained at a level similar to that of the previous months.

Chart 4.1 | Liquidity in pesos of financial entities Chart 4.2 | Liquidity in dollars of financial entities

Regarding the latest regulatory changes in the minimum cash regime, it should be noted that as of August, the limit of the net excess position of LELIQ is expanded by the positive difference between the limit for the cash position under the rules on "Global net position in foreign currency" and the monthly average of daily balances of the cash position observed⁶. In this way, it seeks to generate incentives for entities to reduce their holdings of foreign currency in cash. On the other hand, as of September, financial entities that capture deposits constituted by natural persons for an amount of up to $1 million at the minimum interest rate in effect since August, will be able to expand their net excess position of LELIQ by 13% of the average monthly balance of those deposits from the previous month⁷.

In a context where loans in foreign currency continue to decline, while deposits grow, banking liquidity in foreign currency registered an increase of 2.6 p.p. and averaged 74.4% of deposits. The increase in liquidity was concentrated in current accounts at the BCRA, while cash in banks, in terms of deposits, presented a slight decline (see chart 4.2).

## 5. Interest Rates8

In August, a new minimum interest rate began to apply for fixed-term deposits in pesos from individuals for amounts up to $1 million9. Moving forward with its policy to protect savings in domestic currency, the BCRA determined that the minimum interest rate would be raised from 79% to 87% of the monetary policy rate, bringing it to 33.06% nominal annual, which is equivalent to an effective annual interest rate of 38.57%. This provision is mandatory for financial entities in Group A and branches of foreign banks classified as systematically important (G-SIB), which concentrate 90% of system deposits. It is worth noting that entities that capture deposits at the minimum interest rate will be able to expand their net surplus position in LELIQ starting in September (see "Liquidity" Section). Likewise, the BCRA increased to 0.75 the coefficient that determines the fixed early redemption rate for deposits with early redemption option in UVA, with said rate increasing from 26.6% to 28.5%.

In this way, the interest rate on retail deposits was positioned above the interest rates paid in the wholesale segment, whose minimum remuneration remained at 30.02%, (34.52% e.a.). Regarding interest rates in the interbank market, the 1-day Call rate remained stable throughout the month at low levels, reflecting market liquidity conditions (averaging 15.9%). Meanwhile, the repo rate among third parties showed an upward trend and averaged 17.6% in August, 4.2 p.p. more than in July (see Graph 5.1).

 Graph 5.1 | Passive and interbank interest rates | Graph 5.2 | Active interest rates

Active interest rates applied to credits intended mainly for commercial purposes fell during the month. The rate corresponding to document discounting showed a downward trend throughout August. On average it decreased 2.3 p.p. compared to July, reaching 24.1%, reflecting the impact of loans to SMEs at the maximum rate of 24%. For its part, the rate charged for single-signature documents averaged 29.6%, 1.5 p.p. below the July value. It is worth noting that this interest rate presents high volatility - in mid-August it reached a maximum of 34% to end the month at 28.8% - because banks that provide this type of financing to large companies are concentrated in a small group and depending on the borrowing company there is great dispersion in the interest rates charged. Advances continued with the downward trend observed since May and thus averaged 32.3%, 1.1 p.p. compared to the

 Monthly Monetary Report | August 2020 | BCRA | 10
previous month. Lastly, the interest rate on personal loans recorded a slight increase compared to July (0.5 p.p.) and averaged 51.1% (see Graph 5.2).

## 6. International Reserves

The balance of international reserves of the Central Bank stood at US$42,842 million at the end of August, which implied a fall of US$544 million compared to the close of the previous month (see Graph 6.1). This decrease is explained fundamentally by net foreign exchange sales by the BCRA and net payments by the National Treasury to international organizations, which were partially offset by the increase in minimum cash accounts and gains from valuation of net external assets.

It is worth noting that in the month under analysis, the BCRA and the People's Bank of the People's Republic of China agreed to renew their bilateral currency swap agreement for a new period of 3 years. These agreements contribute to promoting the strengthening of financial conditions to support trade and investment between both countries, promote greater financial stability and strengthen the relationship between both central banks.
The nominal peso/US dollar exchange rate increased 2.3% between the end of July and the end of August, closing the month at 74.0. The multilateral real exchange rate, for its part, experienced some appreciation until closing the month at a value of 118.7, partially undoing the increase observed since mid-May. In this way, the MRER continues to be positioned at levels similar to those at the beginning of the year (see Chart 6.2).
