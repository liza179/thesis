## Monetary Situation (August 2001)

During August, the main monetary variables continued to show negative evolution,
fundamentally until the third week of the month. From that moment on, a growth in
deposits was observed that reversed the negative trend that had been shown since July. Similar behavior was
observed in loans to the private sector. For their part, interest rates, despite the high volatility
evidenced, showed, in general, a downward trend throughout the period.

Total deposits decreased on average $5,000 million (6.4%). This decline corresponded almost entirely to
placements by the private sector which, considering end-of-month balances, decreased $2,500 million
(3.6%). In particular, time deposits represented more than two-thirds of the total decline in
deposits. It is worth noting that in this type of placement, which since early July had shown declines, an
increase was observed starting on August 22. Thus, added to the increase in savings account
placements, private deposits grew around $1,000 million during the fourth week of the month.

International reserves of the financial system decreased on average $4,800 million, although considering
end-of-month balances the decline was $2,500 million (11.6%). For its part, monetary circulation decreased 10%,
while the integration of minimum cash requirements and liquidity requirements at the BCRA and at the
international custodian fell 25%. It is worth recalling that at the end of July, liquidity requirements had been reduced by
one percentage point for the bimonthly position July-August to address the illiquidity generated by the loss
of deposits. Nevertheless, bank reserves (includes, in addition to the aforementioned integration, the cash in
circulation that entities possess) represented on average 19% of total deposits.

Loans to the private sector showed evolution similar to that of deposits with a decline until the
third week of the month and an increase in the last days of August.

Interest rates on average decreased with respect to July. The interest rate for
interbank loans decreased sharply, reaching during the last days levels similar to those registered before
the July crisis. Thus, although they averaged 23% and 11% for pesos and dollars,
respectively, the last days of the month reached levels of around 5% for both segments. For their part, the interest rates for
fixed-term deposits of more than one million pesos, despite showing a trend similar to the previous ones, remained at
high levels, ending the month of August at levels slightly lower than those observed in the previous month,
27% and 19% for pesos and dollars respectively.

## Private Banks (data as of June 2001)
The total assets of private banks decreased 3.6% during June 2001. The decline in this item fundamentally reflects the negative evolution of the line "Other credits from financial intermediation" (20.2%), which in turn captured the effect of changes in the rules regarding minimum liquidity requirements and minimum cash (RML and EM). In this way, the majority of the contraction of the aforementioned concept – and the decline in public securities holdings – is explained by the exclusion of reverse repo operations –with guarantees of securities or BCRA deposit certificates– as a computable instrument for the integration of RML. Likewise, the increase in available funds was due to the allocation in the current accounts of entities at the BCRA – which, as of June 2001, are computed as integration of RML and EM–. On the other hand, an increase in total loans was recorded for the first time in the year (0.3%), mainly driven by loans to the financial sector (25.1%) and to the non-financial private sector (0.5%), while loans to the public sector fell (8.1%) due to bond-note exchanges recorded as loans for public securities. Finally, the net asset from accounting duplications generated by reverse repo, forward and spot operations to be settled, registered an increase of 2.3%. Regarding alternative funding sources, loan lines from abroad and negotiable obligations registered an increase of 3.4% and 0.5% respectively.

In June 2001, private banks recorded profits corresponding to 4.2% of net equity in annualized terms. With respect to the previous month, a deterioration was registered mainly due to lower results from holdings of financial assets and from interest, and due to an increase in loan loss provisions. The greater gains from services derived from the sovereign debt exchange carried out during the period helped to mitigate the decline in profitability. Finally, the second quarter of 2001 concluded with profits of 7.3% of net equity in annualized terms, slightly lower than the 7.7% recorded during the first quarter of the year. In the quarterly comparison, the increase in net income from services and other items was offset by the increase in loan loss provisions and administrative expenses. Finally, the profitability of 2001 accumulated to the first half of the year amounted to 7.5% of net equity in annualized terms.

The total capital requirement of private banks registered a decline of 2.5% in June 2001, derived fundamentally from the decrease in capital requirement for credit and interest rate risk (2.1%) – reflecting the negative effect of the behavior of risk-weighted assets – and the decline in market risk requirement. On the other hand, total capital integration registered a reduction of 1.1%, mainly due to the decrease in basic net equity (1.4%). The aforementioned changes caused a slight increase in integration excess, which in terms of total capital requirement went from 49.4% to 51.5%. Finally, total capital integration in terms of risk-weighted assets according to Basel amounted to 20.8%, placing itself at a level far superior to that established by local regulation and the minimum requirements recommended internationally.
