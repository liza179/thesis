Monthly Monetary Report

SEPTEMBER 2004

## CONTENTS

1. Summary 1
   • In September, the Broad Monetary Base (BMA) showed a decline of $172 million compared to the previous month, positioning itself at $46,446 million and displaying a year-on-year variation of 9%. The BMA adjusted by passive repo operations increased $580 million compared to August (20% y.o.y.), positioning itself clearly within the bands established in the Monetary Program for the third quarter of the year. The public and financial sectors continued generating contractions of the BMA while net foreign currency purchases in the exchange market were the main source of expansion. This month, for the first time since 2002, BCRA securities maturities exceeded placements, resulting in an increase of the BMA.

   • The BCRA continued actively participating in the repo market, with the objective of setting a short-term reference interest rate. The daily volume traded in this market increased 16% compared to August and corresponded entirely to passive repos for the Institution. Based on this action by the BCRA, the interbank lending market (call) showed greater activity and in September operated near $600 million daily. In particular, the 7-day term segment showed a significant increase that led it to represent almost 40% of the call stock (in March its participation was 20%).

• In the interbank market, interest rates for 7-day operations continued converging to the interest rate corridor established by the BCRA (around 80% of operations in this segment were agreed at rates between 2.5% and 3.5%).

4.1. Monetary Aggregates in Pesos 7

Passive interest rates rose gradually, especially in the wholesale segment. For their part, active interest rates remained relatively stable.

4.2. Dollar Deposits 8

• Total means of payment remained stable, since the increase in sight placements by the public sector (due to tax collection) was offset by a significant transfer of transactional funds from the social security system to time deposits. This fact led to time deposits increasing sharply in September ($1,540 million). It should be noted that time placements by the private sector showed an increase of $420 million, which breaks down into an increase of $250 million of those adjustable by CER and $170 million of non-adjustable placements (showing growth for a second consecutive month). The broadest monetary aggregate in pesos (M3) increased $1,440 million (1.2% in the month and 20.6% y.o.y.).

4.3. Bank Liquidity 9

• Loans continued growing during September ($530 million). The most active credit lines were personal loans and documents. For the first time since December 2000, an increase in loans with real guarantees was observed (pledged loans showed their most significant growth and mortgages their smallest decline). Likewise, a lengthening of terms can be appreciated.

5. Loans 10

• The peso appreciated in nominal terms against the dollar (0.6%) and the euro (0.3%), while it showed a depreciation of similar magnitude to the previous month against the real (3.1%). The Multilateral Real Exchange Rate Index shows that the peso depreciated 0.7% in September, accumulating a real depreciation (gain in competitiveness) of 3.6% over the last 12 months.

Monthly Monetary Report – SEPTEMBER 2004

2. Monetary Program

In September, the Broad Monetary Base (BMA) stood at $46,446 million, $172 million below the level recorded in August and 9% above the value shown in the same month of the previous year. The decrease observed in this variable during the month breaks down into a fall of $80 million in currency in circulation and a reduction of $92 million in bank reserves in pesos.

Sector Financial BCRA Public Sector Private Sector Securities of S. External Others BMA

Regarding the factors that explain the variation of the BMA, it should be mentioned that BCRA repo operations involved a decrease of $775 million in this variable during the month; while the rest of operations in the financial sector, fundamentally cancellations of illiquidity assistance within the framework of "matching," implied a monetary contraction of $213 million.

Likewise, financing with funds that were deposited in local banks of a portion of the public sector's payments of obligations with International Financial Institutions (IFI) led to a reduction of the BMA of $893 million.
Source: BCRA

On the other hand, for the first time since December 2002, LEBAC and NOBAC maturities exceeded placements, resulting in a slight increase in the BMA ($114 million).

The net purchase of foreign currency from the private sector was the factor that led to greater growth of the BMA, implying an expansion of this aggregate of $1,225 million during the month (see Chart 2.1).

it is more appropriate to monitor compliance with the Monetary
Program using the BCRA's short-term liabilities, defined as the sum of the BMA and passive repurchase agreements arranged by it. In September, the BMA adjusted for repurchase agreements was located at $51,149 million, which implied a monthly increase of $580 million and a year-over-year variation of 20%. In this way, the evolution of the BMA adjusted for repurchase agreements continued to fall within the band provided for in the Monetary Program (see Chart 2.2).

3. Interest Rates

In the interbank market, interest rates continued to converge toward the interest rate corridor established by the BCRA. Passive interest rates rose slightly, especially in the wholesale segment. For its part, active interest rates remained relatively stable, with the exception of personal loans which experienced a further decline.

The BCRA continued focusing on the 7-day term to set a short-term reference interest rate, maintaining the levels observed the previous month. Thus, it continued offering to take excess funds from financial entities at 2.5% and to provide resources to them at 3.5%. Given the high proportion that operations in which the BCRA is a counterparty represent, its interest rate defined the market average (see Graph 3.2.1.2).

The interest rates in the 1 business day call market, which
continues to be the most traded term (56% of average stock), 
increased slightly in September. At the beginning of the month it 
traded at 2.2% and September ended at 2.3% (see Chart 3.2.2.1), 
resulting in an average of 2.2%, 0.1 p.p. higher than that traded 
in the preceding month. The daily amounts traded in that segment 
remained around $500 million.

In the case of the 7-day term segment, the interest rates

Passive interest rates continued to register positive variations
in September. As in previous months, the most significant increase
took place in the wholesale segment and, within this, in the 
shortest-term bracket (30-44 days), although increases were also
observed in almost all the rest of the rates. This phenomenon
Chart 3.3.1 responds mainly to the expectations of financial entities in relation

 0.15 p.p. between month-end, standing at 2.25% at the end of
 September. The lower level and growth rate of these latter
 rates is associated with the continuous influx of tax funds that
 public entities have, which gives them greater
 liquidity margin in relation to private entities. The
 increase in wholesale yields was not passed on to
 the retail segment, where interest rates in the 30-44 day bracket

 case of private banks and in the case of public banks, average

The increase in fixed-term placements was partly offset by the decrease of $300 million in the stock of CEDRO with CER, which resulted in a net increase in fixed-term deposits of $1,240 million. This increase, added to the increase of $140 million in other deposits and the slight rise in means of payment, resulted in a growth of $1,440 million Figure 4.2.1 of the broadest monetary aggregate (M3), which reflects an increase of 1.2%.

Source: BCRA (US$1,600 million between April and August), dollar deposits increased only US$33 million in September. The public sector, which through sustained foreign currency acquisition in the market was the main driver of that growth in dollar placements (70% of the total), did not conduct operations in the foreign exchange market during September. Furthermore, in the middle of this month it used part of these funds to make external payments (see Figure 4.2.1).

 Specifically, the September increase is composed of an increase of US$68 million in private sector deposits

partially offset by a decrease of US$35 million in public sector deposits. By type of deposits, the increase is explained mostly by fixed-term placements (in the 30 to 59-day range) of the private sector while the increase of US$36 million in private sight deposits was offset by an equivalent decline in public savings account deposits.

Regarding the minimum cash requirement regime, the surplus position in September was 1.8% with respect to total deposits (approximately $1,700 million), slightly lower than that observed in the previous month and more than 6 percentage points lower than that of December 2003 (see Chart 4.3.2). The gradual channeling of funds toward the loan market and repurchase agreements explains the reduction throughout the year in the surplus position of minimum cash and a redistribution of the same, since it is currently concentrated in almost 70% in private banks (whereas from the end of last year until June of this year, it was concentrated in 70% in public banks). Specifically, private banks reduced their position by 3.3 percentage points with respect to December 2003 while public banks did so by almost 9 percentage points.

In the segment of deposits in dollars, the minimum cash requirement position continues to show a strong excess of integration, with more than 50% of deposits in foreign currency maintained by financial entities in cash and in their current accounts at the BCRA⁴. It is worth mentioning that, alternatively, entities could apply said funds to export financing, interbank loans, BCRA Notes, financial trusts whose underlying assets are loans intended for export financing, loans to producers of final or intermediate goods that have endorsements from exporters and debt securities or participation certificates in financial trusts issued in foreign currency and with public offering authorized by the National Securities Commission whose underlying assets are constituted by

For this reason, the excess liquidity that financial entities are credited with by regulation is less than that mentioned in this section in which only the requirement that arises from applying reserve coefficients on foreign currency obligations is computed, without considering the increase in the same equivalent to the failure to apply resources.

documents purchased by the trustee for the purpose of financing operations related to exports⁵.

If both segments of deposits are consolidated, the existing liquidity (including pesos and dollars at the free exchange rate) reaches $32,300 million (29.8% of total deposits), while the minimum cash requirement position totals approximately $7,700 million (7 percentage points) in excess of what is required by the BCRA as minimum cash requirement.

## 5. Loans⁶

Loans in pesos to the private sector continue showing sustained growth, yielding an increase in September of $530 million, an increase that is similar to that of August and somewhat lower than that of the preceding months. This increase in
-600 loans leads to greater secondary creation of money that
 Jan-03 Mar-03 May-03 Jul-03 Sep-03 Nov-03 Jan-04 Mar-04 May-04 Jul-04 Sep-04is reflected in an incipient increase in the monetary multiplier
Source: BCRA
 By credit line it can be seen that commercial loans continue to be the main drivers of growth, followed by consumption loans (see Graph 5.1). For the first time since December 2000, an increase in loans with real guarantees is observed, as a result of a month where the greater growth of pledge loans ($60 million) is combined with the smaller decline in mortgage loans ($30 million).

 Favored by the increase in formal employment and by better consumer expectations, consumption financings registered another increase in September, this time of $130 million (2.2%). Personal loans showed a new increase of $160 million (5.2%). On the contrary, financings made through credit cards registered a slight contraction of $30 million (1.1%) (see Graph 5.3), which is explained by the effect of the end of the promotion of installment purchases without interest in June that, as we explained in

Source: BCRA net declines, amortizations and prepayments continue to exceed new financings, so a new decline is observed, this time of $30 million (0.4%), a decline that is the smallest of recent months.
Observing the evolution of new mortgage loans granted (see Graph 5.5), a notable growth can be appreciated in recent months, reaching $130 million in July, which implies extraordinary growth in relation to the $30 million monthly average granted during 2002 and 2003. All of this indicates that the trajectory of this line would be approaching its inflection point, so it is expected that in the coming months it will manage to reverse its contractionary phase.

Loans with Real Guarantee
(Average monthly change)

The behavior described up to here implies a lengthening of the average terms of financing, which is also verified by analyzing the composition by term of new loans (see Graph 5.4). There it can be verified that new financing concentrates in longer terms. In the case of new mortgage loans, it can be seen that with the latest information available in July, around 50% were arranged at terms exceeding 5 years. In the case of new chattel mortgage loans, it can be observed that of the almost $70 million granted in July, 2/3 correspond to loans for more than one year. Finally, regarding loans implemented through documents, of the $860 million disbursed, more than half of new financing corresponds to loans for more than 90 days. However, in all cases the amounts granted are still much lower than those granted prior to the crisis.

**6. Financial Assets Market**

The main financial assets traded in the local market registered increases in their quotations during September. Among them, leading shares stood out for their good performance, which managed to reverse the negative result they had accumulated through August. Likewise, in the private debt market, a new primary placement of securities in pesos was carried out. On the other hand, the peso depreciated in real terms by 0.7% with respect to a basket of currencies of the main trading partners.

**6.1. Foreign Exchange Market**

At the end of September, the balance of international reserves of the BCRA reached US$18,224 million, approximately US$150 million above the level recorded one month earlier. As has occurred for several months, public sector operations implied a decline in reserves while private sector operations involved an increase. In the first case, the outflow of foreign exchange was linked to net payments abroad that the National Government had to make, while in the second, the increase in reserves was related to the surplus of the Single and Free Exchange Market.

The volume traded in the spot foreign exchange market remained at the same levels as in August. However, although the aggregate was similar, there was an increase in the Electronic Exchange Market (MEC) and a reduction in the amount traded in SIOPEL. The BCRA's participation in total traded decreased slightly, standing at 5.5% (see Graph 6.1.1).

 the greater number of operations with PRE 08 (in pesos adjusted

 securities with greater liquidity increased notably toward the end

Source: BCRA and CAFCI analysis were those of equity funds, whose assets increased by more than $130 million, which implied a monthly increase of 13.1%. This growth was mainly due to the significant increase evidenced by the value of the fund shares of these funds, whose evolution is closely linked to that of the MERVAL index, as mentioned in previous reports. The exceptional upward trajectory of said index, explained in section 6.2.1., made it possible to significantly raise the monthly profitability of equity funds, which was on the order of 9% (yielding an annualized return of 112%) (see Chart 6.2.3.1).

Similarly, mixed funds presented an asset increase for the third consecutive month, close to $13 million, which represents a monthly increase of 10.6%. Most of this increase was due, as in the case of equity funds, to the good performance of the MERVAL index which pushed up the return of these funds, which went from 21% in August to 45% in September.

in the assets of these funds, at least until the spread between their return and that of their substitutes does not match the liquidity premium of investors.

6.2.4. Private Securities

Within the framework of the comprehensive restructuring of its financial liabilities, Telecom Personal S.A. achieved a participation rate of over 99% in the process of accession to the Extrajudicial Preventive Agreement (APE), which will not be presented for judicial approval, as the company had previously stated would occur in the case of receiving support from at least 95% of the holders. The total amount refinanced will be announced shortly.

After having extended the maturity date of its debt exchange offer, Mastellone Hermanos S.A. decided to improve its initial proposal, achieving an estimated participation of over 88% on a total of FV US$329 million to
Chart 6.2.4.1 restructure. The new proposal maintains the three original options

 Likewise, Banco Río launched a program for the
 securitization of mortgage loans through the issuance of
 debt securities and participation certificates in financial trusts
 for a maximum amount of up to $200 million.

 Regarding the behavior of the secondary market of
 corporate debt instruments, based on the analysis of yield curves,
 it is observed that investors continue to differentiate between
 debtors who never ceased to service their obligations and those
 who had to resort to restructuring their financial liabilities. In
 terms of IRR, the additional premium required for ON issued after
 restructuring processes ranges from 5 p.p. to 7 p.p. For
 restructured ON, IRR decreases of 1 p.p. were observed on
 average compared to late August (see Graph 6.2.4.1).
