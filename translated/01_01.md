# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information
Communication No. 39.360

## Monetary Situation (December 2000)

Considering average figures, in December 2000 total deposits decreased $290 million (0.4%) as a consequence of the behavior of public sector deposits, since private sector placements remained practically at the levels of the previous month.

It is important to clarify that although the average of private deposits remained unchanged, this was a consequence of the negative carryover effect from November, since in December they increased almost $900 million (1.1%), mainly due to the behavior of peso placements linked to economy transactions. Related to this, the means of payment of the private sector (currency in circulation, current account deposits and savings accounts, all denominated in pesos) increased almost $1,000 million (4.1%) with respect to the November average.

The international reserves of the financial system increased on average $440 million, due to the increase in monetary circulation, since the integration of liquidity requirements fell $370 million (2%). With respect to this last point, it should be noted that although the regulations in effect in December allowed for lower integration compared to that month's requirement of up to 20%, to be compensated in January, the system as a whole only failed to integrate 4%.

Regarding domestic interest rates, they generally increased until mid-December, ending the month at levels slightly higher than those at the end of the previous month. The change in interest rate behavior was associated with the completion of efforts to assemble the financial support package.

## Private Banks (data as of October 2000)

The group of private banks registered a decline of 0.8% in total assets during October 2000, mainly due to a decrease of 0.8% in total loans and secondly to the fall in available funds (3.3%). As for alternative sources of funding, negotiable obligations registered an increase of 5.3%, while loan lines from abroad decreased 10.4% and returned to August 2000 levels.

In the first month of the fourth quarter of 2000, private banks recorded profits equivalent to 0.6% of net equity in annualized terms. The decrease in benefits obtained in October compared to the previous month was due particularly to lower results generated by the holding of financial assets. It is noted that the decrease observed in administrative expenses partially offset the decline in net income from assets, which in turn registered its lowest level of the year.

Due to modifications in the Monthly Information System, portfolio quality information is not available at this time.

In October 2000, the capital requirement of private banks increased 3.0%, explained almost entirely by the increase in capital requirement for credit risk (3.4%). The latter was mainly due to the increase in risk assets, which in turn rose as a consequence of the increase in loans during September 2000. Capital integration decreased 1.0% in the period analyzed, observing declines in both basic and supplementary equity. The increase in the requirement and the decrease in capital integration caused a reduction in the integration excess, which in terms of the total capital requirement went from 56.8% to 50.7%. Lastly, capital integration in terms of risk-weighted assets according to Basel fell 0.8 percentage points, placing itself at a level (20.4%) well above what is established by local regulation and by international minimum standards.
