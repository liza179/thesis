# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information
 Communiqué No. 34.602

During May, deposits grew on average 0.3% ($220 million), showing a significant increase in the last days of the month. Similarly, a slight dollarization of deposits was observed, driven by the growth of fixed-term placements in dollars. For its part, loans to the non-financial private sector showed a decline of $200 million. However, this decrease in average stock is explained almost entirely by the exclusion, starting in April, of Banco Mendoza S.A. from statistical information.

International reserves of the financial system experienced, on average, a slight decline associated with lower integration of minimum liquidity requirements by financial entities, maintaining the ratio of integration with respect to deposits above 21%.

The increase in sovereign risk was reflected in an increase in domestic interest rates. In this way, the clear downward trend that interest rates had sustained since March was reversed.

Regarding the financial statements of private banks, the latest available information, March 1999, shows important growth during that month. Among the sources of funding, increases in deposits, foreign loan lines, subordinated obligations, and net equity can be highlighted. On the contrary, decreases were recorded in the balances of interfinancial obligations and negotiable obligations. Except for deposits and interfinancial obligations, these movements only reflected the activities of a few entities (in general, first-line retail).

With respect to assets, significant increases are observed in liquidity and loans. The increase in liquidity corresponds mainly to a nominal increase in the holding of public securities, unrelated to the integration of liquidity requirements. For its part, the increase in loans was due to placements of funds at very short term in foreign banks, by some first-line entities.

The profitability of private banks improved substantially in March 1999. In this sense, the result (in annualized terms) was 13.3% of net equity. This strong growth in profits was due fundamentally to the increase in income from holding financial assets—mainly public securities—and, to a lesser extent, to the increase in miscellaneous profits. On the other hand, an increase in charges for non-performance was verified.

The irregular portfolio of private banks fell slightly in terms of financing, reaching 6.8% in March 1999. The decrease in delinquency is explained basically by the reduction in the irregularity of the commercial portfolio, which also recorded the lowest level since August 1998. The continuous decrease in delinquency of credits to companies during the last 4 months is explained in part by the closure during the period of financial entities that recorded high defaults in their commercial portfolio.

The integration of capital for credit risk of private banks continued to increase during March 1999. This meant an important growth in solvency, measured as integration of capital for credit risk over assets weighted by risk according to Basel criteria, which was placed at 18.0%.
