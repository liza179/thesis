 Monetary Report | July of 2011 | BCRA | 2 1. Summary
• In July, total means of payment (M2) presented a marked seasonal behavior, which is associated with the payment of the mid-year bonus and winter vacations. In this way, M2 registered a monthly increase of 4.5%, reaching an average balance of $296,350 million. For its part, means of payment from the private sector (private M2) showed growth of 6.1%, with increases in currency held by the public and in savings account placements partially offset by a decline in current accounts.

• As has been observed in recent months, money creation during the month of July was led by secondary expansion, that is, the granting of loans in pesos. Other factors that contributed to explaining the monthly increase in monetary aggregates were operations of the public sector and net purchases of foreign currency by the Central Bank in the market.

• Time deposits from the private sector showed growth of 0.8%, driven by the increase in placements in the segment of less than $1 million. Although the monthly increase in time deposits from the private sector appears moderate, it is similar to that observed in 2006 and 2007 and allowed that, in the first 7 months of 2011, an average monthly growth superior to that registered in previous years would accumulate. Indeed, between January and July 2011, time placements from the private sector increased at a rate of 2.4% monthly, compared to an average monthly increase that was around 1.5% in the same period of the years 2006, 2007, and 2010.

• Loans in pesos to the private sector grew 5.4% ($10,390 million) in July, registering the largest monthly increase since the exit from the 2001-2002 crisis and reaching a year-over-year expansion rate of 47.1%. Commercial lines were those that contributed most to this increase, explaining more than half of it, with which they continue showing a growth rate above that of lines intended to finance household consumption. In July, the average balance of loans to the private sector, in pesos and in foreign currency, represented 12.9% of GDP, 1.3 percentage points more than in December last year.

• In July, the sixth auction of funds from the Bicentennial Productive Financing Program (PFPB) was conducted. On this occasion, $292 million was awarded, bringing the total allocated since the beginning of the PFPB to $1,829 million, of which $722 million had been disbursed by the end of July.

• Interest rates on LEBAC and NOBAC placements remained relatively stable, while interest rates on reverse repurchase operations were not modified. Both the stock of these securities and that of passive repurchase operations for the Central Bank presented a decline in a context of lower purchases of foreign currency by this Institution.

• Passive interest rates recorded some increases in July. In particular, the BADLAR rate for private banks showed a monthly increase of 0.4 percentage points and was placed at 11.6%, while, in the retail segment (placements of up to $100 thousand), the interest rate for deposits up to 35 days averaged 9.6%, barely 0.1 percentage points more than that observed the previous month. For its part, active interest rates showed limited variations. The average monthly interest rate for current account overdrafts was around 18.6%, increasing 0.2 percentage points with respect to June, while the average monthly interest rate for promissory notes was placed at 15.4%, 0.4 percentage points higher than that evidenced the previous month.

Monetary Aggregates registered a monthly increase of 4.5%, reaching
(July 2011, on average)
an average balance of $296,350 million (see Chart

Deposits in US$ 2.1). This seasonal behavior is associated with the

In July, the broadest monetary aggregate in local currency
(M3³) registered a monthly increase of 3.7%. Meanwhile,
private M3 increased 4.5%. This growth of monetary
aggregates continued to be driven mainly by peso loans to
the private sector, which maintain a sustained and elevated
expansion rate (see Loans section).
Other factors that fed monetary aggregates were
operations of the public sector and, to a lesser extent, net
purchases of foreign currency that the Central Bank
made in the market.

Regarding primary creation of money, the monetary
base grew 5.1%, reaching a monthly average balance of
$186,025 million. The decrease in reverse repo balances
for the Central Bank and LEBAC and
Chart 2.2 NOBAC was the main factor in the increase of the monetary

a set of factors, among which the collection of the
semi-annual complementary salary stands out, the disbursement of retroactive amounts resulting from some salary
agreements and occasional financing operations that temporarily increased the balances of these accounts.

Source: BCRA Chart 3.2). The group of public banks accumulated a surplus of 0.2% of their deposits in pesos, while that of private banks ended July with an integration greater than the reserve requirement of around 0.5% of their deposits in pesos.

For the foreign currency segment, the Minimum Cash surplus continued to decrease to reach 38.5% of total deposits in dollars. In particular, the difference between the integration and the reserve requirement was reduced by 0.9 p.p. in July, due mainly to the application of resources to the granting of loans in foreign currency to the private sector, mainly aimed at pre-financing exports, as well as to the decrease in deposits belonging to the public sector.

those observed in the previous month (see Graph 5.1). For its part, the average term of LEBAC awarded increased compared to June, concentrating more than 80% of placements in securities between 4 and 5 months in term. Conversely, in the case of NOBAC, the longer-term securities decreased their participation over the total placed in the month, considerably increasing those securities of between 6 to 9 months in term (see Graph 5.2).

During July, the Central Bank repurchased securities in the secondary market for an approximate amount of $500 million. Said intervention concentrated in mid-month, with the objective of mitigating the effects of specific liquidity needs, which temporarily affected the interest rates of the interbank lending market (see Interbank Market section). Given that the month's maturities exceeded the awarded amount, the stock of LEBAC and NOBAC in circulation decreased around 6%, placing itself at approximately $85,800 million at the end of July.

With respect to the secondary market of LEBAC and NOBAC, a lower traded amount was registered explained by the decrease in negotiated letters. On the other hand, operations of short-term NOBAC (90 days) stood out. For its part, interest rates increased in relation to the previous month, placing themselves slightly above the cut-off levels in the primary market.

**Interfinancial Markets**

**Repo Market 1**

As in previous months, in July, the interest rates of Central Bank repo operations did not present modifications. In this way, the rate for passive repos at 1 and 7 days in term remained at 9% and 9.5% respectively. For their part, those corresponding to active repos continued at 11% and 11.5% for the same terms.

Monetary Report | July 2011 | BCRA | 8 In short, the monthly average stock of net repurchase
agreements (reverse minus repurchase) for the Central
Bank decreased 33% in July, positioning itself around
$6,900 million, and composed in its majority (77%) by
one-day-term repurchase agreements.

Interbank Market¹

During the course of July, the level of interest rates in
the interbank market was affected by specific liquidity
needs of financial entities. In particular, between July 12
and 18, the interest rates in the interbank lending market
showed levels around 3 p.p. higher than the values—
practically unchanged—that they showed during recent
months. With the objective of mitigating the impact of
these specific situations, the Central Bank provided
liquidity through some of the available mechanisms for
this purpose: repurchase agreements and purchases of
LEBAC and NOBAC in the secondary market. In this
scenario, interest rates, in less than a week, returned to
their previous levels (see Chart 5.3). In short, the monthly
average of interest rates in the interbank market (call)
increased 0.7 p.p., positioning itself at 10.2%, for both
total operations and for one business day operations. On
Chart 5.4 the other hand, the average daily amount negotiated in the
call market rose slightly ($70 million), reaching $1,100

Source: BCRA the highest level of 2011 ($1,000 million higher than the
previous month).

Passive Interest Rates¹

During recent months, the growth rate of loans in pesos,
which presented outstanding performance, exceeded that
recorded by deposits in pesos. In this context, passive
interest rates registered slight increases in July.

Monetary Report | July 2011 | BCRA | 9
In particular, the average monthly interest rates paid by private financial entities for deposits of up to 35 days registered increases, mainly in the wholesale segment (deposits of more than $1 million). The greatest variation was recorded in the BADLAR rate of private banks, which after a monthly increase of 0.4 p.p., stood at 11.6%. For its part, in the retail segment (placements of up to $100 thousand), the interest rate for deposits up to 35 days averaged 9.6%, barely 0.1 p.p. more than that observed in the previous month (see Graph 5.4).

For its part, in the BADLAR futures rate market, significant amounts were traded, mainly at shorter terms (one and two months). For its part, the interest rates of these contracts were situated at levels slightly higher than those recorded in the previous month. Additionally, the longer-term contracts corresponded to those with maturities in December 2012, whose rate stood at around 17.5% (1.6 p.p. higher than that corresponding to the same contracts traded in April, the last month in which contracts with this maturity had been operated).

**Active Interest Rates**

In an analogous manner to that observed for the most relevant passive interest rates, in July, the monthly averages of active interest rates registered limited increases in almost all financing lines.

The highest increases were recorded in loans directed to commercial activities which, being more concentrated in short-term operations, reflect more quickly changes in prevailing liquidity conditions (see Graph 5.5). In effect, the rate of unsecured notes stood at around 15.4%, registering an increase of 0.4 p.p.. For its part, the interest rate of discounted notes also showed a monthly increase (0.3 p.p.) standing at 13.8%. With respect to total overdrafts in current accounts, the average monthly interest rate was positioned at 18.6%, observing a monthly increase of 0.2 p.p.. This increase was driven mainly by the line of overdrafts in current account for companies of more than $10 million and up to 7 days' term, which reached an average monthly level of 12.3%, 1 p.p. higher than June (see Graph 5.6).

On the other hand, the interest rate for personal loans stood at 29.1%, 0.3 p.p. above the previous month.

Conversely, the average monthly interest rates for longer-term loans did not register significant changes in July. In effect, the interest rate for mortgage loans to families stood at 14.7 (0.1 p.p. lower than the previous month), while that corresponding to chattel mortgage loans remained at 18.1%.

**6. International Reserves and Foreign Exchange Market**

The balance of international reserves was US$ 51,923 million at the end of July, accumulating an increase of US$ 228 million compared to the end of June (see Graph 6.1). One of the factors that explained the increase in the month was the variation in the Dollar quotation
40 American with respect to other currencies. Meanwhile, the
 Jul-07 Jan-08 Jul-08 Jan-09 Jul-09 Jan-10 Jul-10 Jan-11 Jul-11
 Source: BCRA net purchases by the Central Bank in the Single and
 Free Foreign Exchange Market (MULC) accumulated during the month
 were practically null, while the dollar current accounts
 of financial entities decreased mainly as a result of the
 application of foreign currency resources in the granting of
 loans in such denomination to the private sector.

 In the foreign exchange market, the peso depreciated with respect
 to the American Dollar and with respect to the Real (in a
 context of appreciation of the Brazilian currency), while
 Chart 6.2 with respect to the Euro no variation was recorded for the
 Foreign Exchange Market average quotation of the month (since the Euro depreciated
 (average quotations) with respect to the American Dollar). Thus, the average
$/Euro $/Real $/US$ quotations for July were 4.13 $/US$ (0.8% with respect to

 $/Euro $/US$ (Reference) June), 2.64 $/Real (2.4%) and 5.90 $/Euro. In the forward

 of the markets, driven by uncertainty regarding the European
 sovereign debt crisis, the publication of negative data
 (unemployment statistics) and expectations about the decline
 in the rating of its debt, which ultimately occurred at the
 beginning of August. Other factors that had an important impact
 on the markets were the evolution of negotiations over the
 American debt ceiling and rumors about the possibility of
 a new round of quantitative expansion in that country.
 In the third week, a new financial aid package for Greece
 of €109,000 million in official funds was approved (to which
 private sector participation would be added) and good results
 were presented in American quarterly balance sheets. Although
 these latter events allowed part of the declines experienced
 during the month to be offset, all markets in the world
 resumed their downward trend towards the end of July.

 In this sense, the MSCI Global measured in dollars fell
 Chart 7.1 1.9% during the last month (see Chart 7.1). For its
 World Stock Indices part, the MSCI Europe decreased 6.6%, followed by the
 (base index 02/07/07 = 100)
 MSCI Latin America, with a decline of 3.5%, and the S&P

85 125 500 (the main index of the North American market)
 with a decrease of 2.1%. It is the third consecutive month in

75 115 which these three indices registered a decline. As an
 exception is the case of the MSCI Japan, which

65 105 grew 3.5% throughout the month.

In the case of Brazil, the measures implemented during the last month stand out in order to prevent the continued appreciation of its currency (modification of the minimum reserve requirement amount and establishment of a tax, both on the short position in US dollars). On the other hand, the MERVAL (Argentina) and the IPC (Mexico) registered declines of 2% and 1.7%, respectively. Part of the variation of the last two indices was explained by the depreciation of local currencies (0.8 p.p. in Argentina and 0.2 p.p. in Mexico). Finally, the IGBVL (Peru) totaled an increase of 16.8% (0.4 p.p. corresponds to the depreciation of the Peruvian sol), more than recovering from the previous month's decline of 11.8%.

Monetary Report | July 2011 | BCRA | 12 The MERVAL index (Argentina), measured in local currency, closed the month at 3,321 points, decreasing 1.2% compared to the June value and accumulating a decline of 5.7% throughout 2011. In any case, it has increased its value 38.7% compared to the same period of the previous year.

The historical volatility of the MERVAL – 22 sessions – in annualized terms and measured in dollars, was reduced by 0.3 p.p. compared to June to end the month at 18.7%. At Graph 7.2 the same time, the expected volatility of the S&P 500 (measured by the VIX) on average decreased 0.2 p.p., to end at 19%.

For its part, the volume traded daily, on average, in the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange increased for the second consecutive time in the year. In effect, it amounted to $60.3 million, an amount 16.3% higher than that traded during June and 79.3% higher than that of the same month in 2010. This increase was due exclusively to the volume traded during one day, which reached $415 million, when 84.7% of the total amount corresponded to a YPF share sale.

## Sovereign Risk Indicators

Sovereign risk indicators for emerging economies recorded slight increases during July, partly explained by a 36 p.b. cut in Treasury yields. The EMBI+, which measures debt spreads in foreign currency of emerging countries as a whole, increased 12 p.b., ending at 274 p.b., and the EMBI+ Latin America increased from 325 p.b. to 334 p.b.. In the particular cases of Argentina and Brazil, debt spreads rose 24 p.b. to 592 p.b. for the first country and 9 p.b. to 157 p.b. for the second (see Graph 7.2).

Monetary Report | July 2011 | BCRA | 13 above that of previous years (except 2007). Of the seven ONs issued, six were conducted in local currency, for $260 million, and the remaining one in foreign currency, for more than US$50 million.

During this month, one ON (the only one issued in foreign currency) corresponding to Electric Energy represented 45% of the total amount issued. In second place, three placements related to Financial Entities were positioned, one of them Non-Banking, with 33% of the total amount. Additionally, there were two issuances belonging to Other Financial, Securities Market and Insurance Activities, and one issuance of Infrastructure, Transport and Services, which constituted 19% and 3% of the total amount subscribed, respectively.

Among the titles issued in pesos, three ONs will pay a fixed interest rate ranging between 14% and 19%. The three remaining ONs will pay interest equivalent to the BADLAR rate of private banks plus an additional margin that varied between 4% and 4.5%. For its part, the ON issued in foreign currency will pay a fixed rate of 9.75%.

Additionally, among the funds with smaller patrimony, a slight increase was recorded in the mixed income segment (+4.9%) and a decrease in the variable income segment (-2.9%). These variations allowed Money Market funds to recover 0.7 p.p.

The

For its part, the FCIs in foreign currency closed the month with a patrimony of US$470 million, 1.6% lower than the June value, although said decline is reduced to 0.8% if expressed in local currency, as a result of the exchange rate variation. Despite the increase recorded in the patrimony of the mixed income segment (3%), this was not sufficient to counteract the declines in the patrimonies of the fixed income funds

Source: Own elaboration based on CNV data and others The issuances of Financial Trusts (FF) totaled around
 $2,850 million in July, of which $2,000 million
 corresponded to a new placement from the public sector
 intended to finance road infrastructure works, whose
 resources come from the collection of the gasoline tax.
 Excluding this placement, around half of the FF placed in
 the month ($410 million) were issued by retail
 commerce establishments that securitized personal
 loans. The rest was divided in similar parts between
 financial entities ($214 million), which in addition to
 consumer loans securitized credit pledges, and
 mutual societies, cooperatives, non-bank credit card
 issuers and other financial service providers ($205
 million). Likewise, a company from the agricultural
 sector securitized commercial credits for US$ 4.5
 million.

 monthly average recorded throughout the year ($930

 15 million; see Graph 7.5). In particular, this amount
 represents a 24% decrease compared to the previous

 14 month, which is due to the lower number of issuances
 recorded in the month (15 operations, 5 fewer than the

 13 previous month), since the average amount per
 placement remained around $55 million.

Due to the longer maturity of the assets backing the
 issuance of the road infrastructure FF, the duration
 (weighted average by amount) of senior titles was
 located in July at around 50 months, compared to 6
 months in June. However, if this issuance is excluded,
 the duration continues around this period.
