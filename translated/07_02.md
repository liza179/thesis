## 1. SUMMARY

• M2 evolved during February in line with the trajectory projected in the Monetary Program and showed a decline of $110 million. In this way, strict control of the money market equilibrium continued. Among the components of M2, both cash in the hands of the public and sight deposits showed decreases on average.

• The measures adopted by the Central Bank in recent months, aimed at extending the funding term of financial entities, contributed to adding dynamism to fixed-term deposits, which increased their year-on-year growth rate to 39%. During the month they increased $2,660 million, explained by both new funds from the private sector ($1,560 million) and from the public sector ($1,100 million).

• In this way, the monetary aggregate M3 in pesos increased 1.4%, showing the sustained strengthening of money demand.

• The Monetary Base contracted $1,160 million (1.5%) as a result of passive repo arrangements and the placement of BCRA securities (LEBACs and NOBACs). Financial entities continued showing a comfortable minimum cash position which made it possible for them to allocate part of the new funds they received to the repo market, thus generating a contraction of the MB of $1,470 million. Likewise, placements of BCRA securities implied a decline in the MB of $3,420 million. Additionally, as of February the Central Bank began to carry out exchange operations of variable rate instruments for fixed rate ones and also of some of two or fewer years duration for instruments with three years residual term.

• Loans to the private sector increased around $1,490 million (2%) during the month. The increase was led by consumer financing and the increasingly dynamic loans with real guarantees, whose year-on-year growth (26.7%) exceeded for the first time that of commercial financing (24.9%). Additionally, within the framework of the Central Bank's policy to contribute to the increase of long-term credit to families and companies, and to promote the development and strengthening of the capital market, the BCRA anticipated the implementation of modifications to the guidelines for origination and administration of mortgage loans, in order to facilitate access to these credit lines.

• The Central Bank adopted new increases in interest rates for its repo operations. On this occasion the increase was of 0.25 percentage points for all operations, placing at 6.5% and 6.75% the rate for passive operations of 1 and 7 days term, respectively; while it rose to 8.75% for active operations of 7 days.

• Given the existing liquidity in the money market, the BADLAR rate for private banks continued with a downward trend during much of the month showing a slight increase from the last few days which would indicate a change in trend for March with the greater liquidity needs of financial entities at the end of the quarterly minimum cash position.

• At the end of February the stock of international reserves amounted to US$34,936 million and would be close to reaching a historical maximum.
which clarifies the source: • In February 2007 retail inflation measured by the GBA CPI was
 Monetary Report - BCRA 0.3% monthly, a figure that turned out to be lower than that verified in the same month of
 the previous year (0.4%).

 2. Monetary Aggregates1

 M2 evolved during February in line with the trajectory projected in the Monetary Program (see Chart 2.1) and showed a decline of $110 million, which implied strict safeguarding of monetary equilibrium. Among the components of M2, both currency in circulation and sight deposits showed decreases on average.

 In this way, while currency in circulation Graph 2.1 showed a decline of $60 million, deposits in current Evolution of M2 and Monetary Program accounts registered a decrease of $250 million, which was thousands of millions of $ 150 partially offset by the increase of $200 million experienced by savings account placements.

 M2, 30-day moving average
140 On the other hand, fixed-term placements continued showing increases, raising their year-on-year growth rate to
130 39%. In the month they increased $2,660 million, explained by both new funds from the private sector and from the public sector. The
120 increase in fixed-term deposits from the private sector was $1,560 million maintaining its monthly growth rate above 3%. In this
110 way, the year-on-year variation of this type of placements reached 27.7% surpassing that of private sight deposits
100 which was 20.5% (see Chart 2.2). The increase in fixed-term deposits was verified in all time brackets, with placements of
90 more than 3 months being those that continued driving the aforementioned growth.

 In this manner, the broader aggregate in pesos, M3, registered a monthly increase of 1.4% ($2,790 million).

 In the foreign currency segment, deposits from the private Graph 2.2 sector again showed a significant increase (US$170

 Private Sector Deposits in Pesos million) that was distributed practically equally between sight and term deposits. For its part, placements from the
 % (year-on-year var.) public sector presented a small decline of US$12 million.

30 Thus, the total stock of dollar deposits increased around US$160 million and already exceeds US$5,700 million.

20 Ultimately, M3*, which adds currency in circulation and deposits in pesos and dollars, grew 1.5% ($3,370 million) in February.

10 On the other hand, during the month the Monetary Base (MB) contracted $1,160 million (1.5%) as a result of passive repo

2 Monetary Report FEBRUARY 2007
In February 2007, retail inflation measured by the CPI GBA was 0.3% monthly, a figure that was lower than that registered in the same month of 2006 (0.4%). As in the previous months, most of the increase in the period was due to the rise in the Food and beverages category (which explained 0.26 percentage points -p.p.- of the monthly variation), although an important reduction was verified in the rate of increase of this component. The evolution of food was associated mainly with adjustments in the prices of Oils and fats (which increased 2.1% in the month) and Bakery products (1.4%), both goods elaborated from commodities. In the year-on-year comparison, the CPI GBA reduced its variation to 9.6%, continuing with the deceleration initiated in January 2006.

The CPI Rest (approximation to core inflation) presented an increase of 0.7% monthly, in line with the average rise verified between the second and fourth quarter of 2006. This resulted in a reduction of the year-on-year variation of the CPI Rest of 2.5 p.p. against the registration of February of last year, showing a relative stability in recent months. For its part, the Seasonal subindex presented the largest decline in 18 months, encouraged by summer clearance sales in clothing, better supply conditions in fruits and vegetables, and the decline in tourism rates.

All in all, the CPI GBA continues in 2007 with the downward trend in year-on-year terms observed throughout last year, which allows market expectations on the evolution of this index for the current year (REM, 10%) to continue within the band stipulated in the Monetary Program (7-11%).

## 3. Banking Liquidity¹

The liquidity ratio, defined as cash in banks, the current accounts of banks in the BCRA and passive repos arranged with the BCRA as a percentage of total deposits in pesos, remained in February above 18%. Framed in a quarterly position, the banks continued transferring in February their excess balances from their current accounts in the BCRA towards the arrangement of passive repos with the BCRA (see Chart 3.1). Likewise, the entities continued reducing their cash holdings, which had temporarily increased in December in response to the greater liquidity demands typical of that month, returning to maintain in February a ratio of cash to deposits of approximately 3%, a level similar to that existing until November.

In February, the quarterly position period of minimum cash that had begun in December came to an end. The average minimum cash surplus of the 90 days closed at approximately 0.3% of total deposits in pesos (around $500 million), a level similar to that observed during the second half of 2006. Throughout the quarter it was observed that banks accumulated an important surplus during December and part of January, which was fed by the strong increase registered in deposits in those months, and which banks were progressively reducing and directing mostly to repos and BCRA securities. Thus, during February they no longer maintained almost any significant surplus days and the average position remained in decline, falling from...

 Said decline was explained both by the behavior of advances
 (see Chart 4.3), which decreased $140 million (1.3%), as

 and "other loans," which decreased $60 million (1.7%).

 Public Securities

 The main sovereign risk indicators
 increased in February, as evidenced by the evolution of the
 spreads of Credit Default Swaps (CDS) contracts or EMBI. In
 particular, the spreads of Latin American external debt, measured
 by EMBI increased 10 b.p. during February. The same
 Chart 7.3 pattern of behavior was evidenced in emerging countries in
 general, as verified by the increase of 13.3 b.p. of EMBI+.
Pension and Retirement Fund Administrators

The investment portfolio of the Pension and Retirement Fund Administrators (AFJP) totaled $92,589 million as of February 15. In the year-on-year comparison, the equity of the AFJPs increased 28.4% (17.1% in real terms).

When comparing the data from February 15 with the data from January 15, an increase in equity of $2,415 million (2.7%) is observed. This equity increase responds mainly to good profitability, on the order of 2.1% and to a lesser extent to the increase derived from new contributions. The monthly variation in the investment portfolio (not including cash) was $2,646 million and is explained by the increase of $1,500 million in the position of structured financial trusts, the increase of $960 million in the value of the stock position and the increase of $950 million in the value of

previous month. As occurred in January, the only type of fund that
exhibited a decline in its assets was the money market fund. On the
other hand, the main asset increase was for fixed income funds (see
Chart 7.5).

The assets of variable income funds increased by
approximately $55 million (0.8%) during February, an increase
explained by an increase in the subscription of fund shares. The
