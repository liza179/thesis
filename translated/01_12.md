# Monthly Monetary and Financial Information
 Communication No: 42.127

## Monetary Situation (November 2001)

During the month of November, once again monetary variables showed negative developments, especially in the last days of the month. Total deposits decreased on average $3,070 million (4%), with three-quarters of the decline concentrated in fixed-term placements. For its part, deposits in the private sector fell on average $2,580 million. However, if end-of-month balances are considered, the latter fell $4,470 million, of which 40% were withdrawn from the system in the last two days of the month, with the decline corresponding to both sight and term placements.

As of the 22nd, the BCRA introduced changes in the way international reserves and monetary liabilities were presented, with the objective of ensuring greater transparency in the published figures and a more accurate measure of convertibility coverage (Communication No. 42018). As a consequence of those changes, the amounts of active repurchase agreements ceased to be deducted from monetary liability figures, and government securities that were the counterpart to those passive repurchase agreements became part of international reserves. In this way, statistical information began to reflect the accounting treatment of active repurchase operations, regarding both the computation of securities and the full monetary effect of the operation. Considering international reserves calculated in this manner, a decrease of US$ 4,170 million was observed during the month.

Interest rates, in general, showed increases during the first three weeks. As of the fourth week, however, the implementation of a change in the bank reserve regime (Communication "A" 3365) affected their subsequent evolution. Basically, as of that moment, a 100% integration is required for those deposits with remuneration higher than the ceiling established by the BCRA. Thus, passive interest rates decreased as of the 26th. An example of this is that interest rates for fixed-term deposits for amounts exceeding one million pesos for 30-35 days that during the first three weeks of the month registered levels, on average, of 46.4% in pesos and 24.1% in dollars, by the 30th were located at 15.4% and 12%, respectively. Conversely, interest rates for interbank loans increased substantially in the last days of the month, reaching levels never before observed. Their average levels were 98.8% in pesos and 43.2% in dollars, although they ended the month at 543.8% and 131.3% respectively.

## Private Banks (data as of September 2001)

During September 2001, the evolution of total assets of private banks continued its downward trend, falling 2.4%. The main cause of the aforementioned variation resulted from the decrease in forward purchase and sale operations (17.8%), which for their part registered an accumulated decline of 28.8% during the current year. On the other hand, the increase in available funds (7.7%), linked to the positive evolution of the accounts for meeting minimum liquidity requirements and minimum cash, contributed to reducing the decline in total assets. Consequently, net assets excluding accounting duplications generated by repurchase, forward and spot settlement operations, recorded a slight increase of 0.3%. Finally, it is worth noting the significant growth in private securities holdings (25.3%).

Regarding the behavior of alternative funding sources for private banking, foreign credit lines and negotiable obligations fell 7.5% and 2.0% respectively.
During the month under analysis, the group of private banks recorded losses equivalent to 2.9% of net equity on an annualized basis. The sharp decline in profitability was due especially to the increase in charges for loan losses and, secondly, to the fall in results derived from the holding of financial assets and net interest income generated. The aforementioned effects were slightly cushioned by the decrease in income tax accrued. Finally, the results of the third quarter amounted to 4.3% of net equity on an annualized basis. The main cause of the deterioration in the results of private banks compared to the previous quarter was the growth in administrative expenses and charges for loan losses, particularly in September 2001. Consequently, accumulated annual profits declined to 6.4% of net equity on an annualized basis.

The credit portfolio quality of private banks deteriorated during September 2001. The increase in the irregular portfolio and the fall in total financing caused an increase in irregularity of 0.3 percentage points, ending the period at 9.8%. Although private banks as a whole increased their provisions for loan losses, net exposure to credit risk –defined as the irregular portfolio minus provisions in terms of financing– grew, rising from 2.7% to 2.9%. The negative evolution of net equity contributed to increasing equity exposure to credit risk –defined as the irregular portfolio minus provisions in terms of net equity–, rising from 11.8% to 12.6%.

The total capital requirement of private banks recorded a slight decline of 1.0% in September 2001, derived fundamentally from the decrease in capital requirement for credit risk (1.5%), which in turn reflects the negative evolution of risk-weighted assets. On the other hand, total capital integration declined 1.2% due particularly to the fall in basic net equity (1.1%). The variations in capital requirement and integration were almost completely offset, so the excess of total capital integration in terms of total capital requirement did not register significant variations. However, total capital integration in terms of risk-weighted assets according to Basel rose 0.5 percentage points, placing it at a level (21.3%) much higher than that established by local regulation and international minimum recommended values. The foregoing is because the capital adequacy indicator does not include the positive effect on the capital requirement of the increase in the risk indicator in September 2001.
