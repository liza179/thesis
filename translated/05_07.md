## 1. SUMMARY

• In July the average of the BMA was positioned at $54,478 million, due to the seasonal increase in money demand. Likewise, the BCRA continued with the prudential policy of accumulating international reserves, so the greater demand for pesos was supplied through the external sector. At the end of July international reserves exceeded US$25,000 million, recovering the level of March 2001.

• The increase in the stock of LEBAC and NOBAC was $945 million compared to the end of June and although there were no early cancellations of rediscounts in this month, cancellations totaling $740 million were scheduled for the first week of August.

• The yield curve of LEBAC in pesos not adjustable by CER experienced a steepening making it possible to extend the term of funding. At the end of July, the interest rates of LEBAC with longer duration had increased more than 0.5 p.p., while those with shorter terms did not register significant variations. Likewise, from the last July auction the BCRA has not made new placements of securities adjustable by CER.

• The BCRA maintained at 4.25%-5.25% the corridor of short-term reference interest rates through its 7-day repo operations, while it maintained at 3.75% the rate of 1-day passive repo operations. Additionally, in order to make the management of liquidity of financial entities more efficient, through Communication "A" 4399, effective as of August 8, the BCRA began to implement a new modality of repos, enabling banks to report daily the balance they wish to maintain in their current accounts at the BCRA, in case the balance observed is higher than desired, it will grant a one-day passive repo for the excess amount.

• The interest rates of the interbank market converged to the corridor established by the BCRA while passive interest rates continued with positive variations in all terms, although in lower magnitude than in the previous month, showing some stabilization in the levels reached at the end of June. Unlike what was observed during the last months, active interest rates showed slight increases in most credit lines.

• The monetary aggregates in pesos presented a new increase linked to the seasonal increase in cash in circulation held by the public, associated with the collection of bonuses and the winter recess, and with the increase in sight deposits of the public sector. Cash in circulation held by the public grew on average around $1,920 million (5.5%), growth similar to that of previous years, while total means of payment (M2) increased around $3,630 million (4.1%), while the broadest monetary aggregate (M3) showed an increase close to $3,020 million (2.1%).

• Loans in pesos to the private sector continued growing, showing an increase of $900 million (2.4%) and accumulated an annual growth of 28.6%. Said increase was generalized across all credit lines. In turn, mortgage loans registered for the second consecutive month a positive variation, while documents in foreign currency...
Foreign currency reached its largest increase since October 2000.

• The foreign exchange market continued to show significant dynamism, driven both by the liquidation of exports and by the inflow of foreign currency for the purchase of public securities, in particular, following the Treasury placements. The behavior of the peso in nominal terms was similar to what was evidenced in recent months and appreciated again in relation to the US dollar (0.5%) and the euro (1.4%), while it depreciated with respect to the real (1.1%). On the other hand, according to the Multilateral Real Exchange Rate Index, the peso appreciated 1.1% with respect to the basket of currencies of its main trading partners and accumulated a real depreciation of 0.5% over the last twelve months.

This entity also continued arranging 1-day transactions, mainly capturing excess funds from financial entities and paying for them a rate of 3.75%. The total interest rate in this market segment, although it showed a temporary increase in mid-month, was located at the end of July around 3.78%, a level similar to that registered at the end of the previous month (see Graph 3.2.2.1).

It should be noted that as of August 8, the BCRA began to implement a new modality of repos that will introduce an additional way to improve the liquidity management of financial entities. Thus, Communication A 4399 enables banks to daily report the balance they wish to maintain in their current accounts at the BCRA. Taking into account this information, in case the balance observed is higher than the desired one, the BCRA will grant them a passive repo for one day for the excess amount.

The arrangement of 1-day repos drove the volume traded in this market and the amount operated on average daily by the BCRA reached $2,098 million, 13% more than in June. At the end of July, the balance of passive repos for the BCRA was $5,427 million and was composed in almost equal parts by 7-day repos and by 1-day repos. For its part, the balance of active repos, after reaching a maximum of $149 million in mid-July, concluded the period at $38 million.

The average daily volume of operations agreed between third parties increased 13% compared to June and was located around $280 million (see Graph 3.2.1.1).

3.2.2 Interbank Market

The interbank market had seen increased activity and elevated interest rates in June, due to high tax concentration and the payment of bonuses that had elevated the funding needs of companies, as well as the growing interest that had been aroused by the securities that the BCRA issues. During July, on the other hand, the interest rates of the interbank market decreased, converging to those established by the BCRA as a short-term reference through its repo operations (see Graph 3.2.2.1).

In the 1 business day segment (which represents around 60% of the stock of financing) the interest rates that had been located at the end of June at 5.3% were gradually reduced, with ups and downs, to end July at 4.1%. The operations for 7 days of term showed similar behavior. Its interest rate, after having closed June at 5.1%, decreased 0.3 p.p. to end July at 4.8%.

The average stock of interfinancial loans amounted to $810 million daily, a level $50 million higher than the previous month and the highest since October 2004. By group of banks, it can be seen that in July the trend outlined the previous month was accentuated, where public banks continued to be the main net providers of funds (see Graph 3.2.2.2), while foreign entities continued to be the main net demandants of funds.

Source: BCRA Sight deposits increased on average around $1,710 million, of which $1,130 million corresponded to resources from the private sector. These deposits began the month at very high levels due to the collection of salaries and bonuses corresponding to the month of June, which extended during the first week of the month, and then resumed their usual intra-monthly behavior, ending the month $330 million below the stock at the end of June. For its part, transactional deposits from the public sector grew on average
Graph 4.1.2 $580 million, although between the end of the month they registered an increase close to $1,430 million. This increase was partly due to the
Fixed Term Deposits in Pesos scarce volume of government debt maturities during the month under
(average monthly variation - July 2005) analysis and partly to the accumulation of liquid funds by the
PRIVATE SECTOR PUBLIC SECTOR government to meet the payment of obligations (amortizations and
Fixed Terms without CER interest on public securities) during the first days of August, which included the placement of new debt securities in pesos and the migration of fixed-term deposits to sight accounts.

-200 which was distributed evenly between adjustable and non-adjustable

end of the month, which is explained, in part, by the transfer, upon
maturity, to sight placements for the aforementioned payment of
obligations in August (see Graph 4.1.2).

 Banking liquidity, defined as the total of current accounts
 of banks at the BCRA, cash in banks and reverse repos with the
 BCRA, remained in July at 19.6% of total deposits in pesos, a level
 similar to that existing the previous month. By bank group, an
 increase in liquidity was observed in public banks along with a decrease
 in that of private banks (see graph 4.3.1). In this regard, private banks reduced their

 ² In accordance with the provisions established by the BCRA, the default in the application of the foreign currency lending capacity verified by financial
 entities in a given period is subject to an equivalent increase in the minimum cash requirement for said period. For this reason, the excess liquidity that
 financial entities accrue in accordance with regulations is less than that mentioned in this section, in which only the requirement that arises from applying
 reserve coefficients on foreign currency obligations is computed, without considering the increase equivalent to the default in the application of resources.
 ³ Loan figures are adjusted for accounting movements, mainly caused by transfers of financial trusts, which although they affect the balances of this
 balance sheet item, do not affect the stock of financings granted.

Likewise, the very favorable situation that the automotive sector is experiencing, which has recovered in recent months the sales levels from the end of 1999, led to financing with pledge guarantee continuing to grow (see Chart 5.5) and registering in July a new increase, on this occasion of $60 million.

Chart 5.5 Finally, in a context in which the good performance of

millions of US$ Documents in Foreign Currency
millions of US$ exports exceeds expectations, due fundamentally to the recovery of agricultural commodity prices, to a larger harvest than expected, and to a very good performance of exports of Industrial Origin Manufactures (IOM), loans to the private sector in foreign currency accelerated their growth rate, registering a growth of US$250 million (12.4%) in July, a figure that represents the largest since September 2000. As in the preceding months, the increase was driven by financing instruments executed through documents that grew US$190 million (13.7%), additionally leaving an important carryover for the next month (see Chart 5.5).

thousands of millions of US$ International Reserves of the BCRA (gold, foreign currency and time placements)

At the end of July, international reserves stood at US$25,105 million, recovering the level recorded in March 2001 (see Chart 6.1.1). During this month the public sector obtained the necessary foreign currency to meet maturities at the beginning of August, mainly the amortization and interest payments of BODEN 2012, through bond placements and purchases in the Unified and Free Foreign Exchange Market. These foreign currencies were maintained in their accounts at the BCRA and far exceeded the payments made, so that government operations originated an increase in international reserves of US$1,277 million. For its part, the net purchases of foreign currency carried out by the BCRA also generated an increase in reserves in July, for a total of US$865 million.

The spot foreign exchange market continued to show significant dynamism, driven both by the liquidation of exports and by the inflow of foreign currency for the purchase of public securities. The amount traded on average daily was slightly lower (4%) than observed the previous month.

The behavior of the peso in nominal terms was similar to that evidenced in recent months and appreciated again in relation to the US dollar (0.5%) and the euro (1.4%), while it depreciated against the real (1.1%). On the other hand, according to the Multilateral Real Exchange Rate Index, the peso appreciated 1.1% against the basket of currencies of its main trading partners and accumulated over the last twelve months a real depreciation of 0.5%.

Chart 6.2.1.1 In the Rosario Forward Market, the quotations of future dollar contracts continued aligned with those of the spot market and registered decreases around 0.6%. The daily amounts traded in July reached historical highs and on average reached $140 million.

 The bonds issued by the National Treasury showed
 significant increases in their quotations in July, driven by demand
 from both local and foreign investors. The peso-denominated
 securities showed the best performance, due to June inflation being
 higher than expected by market consensus. In this way, the yield
 curve of these securities again showed a downward shift compared to
 the end of June (see Chart 6.2.2.1).

In total, in July, placements in national public securities increased $3,258 million (9.6%).

Variable income funds were the most dynamic in Chart 6.2.3.2.2 July, presenting a patrimonial increase of $270 million. This Fixed Income Funds was mainly due to the strong increase in the value of their share millions of $ (Assets at end of month) parts, due to the good performance of the MERVAL index (see 1,200 Monthly patrimonial variation accumulated Section 6.2.1).

Transener completed the restructuring of its financial debt, in default since April 2002, with an adhesion rate of 98.8%. It reduced its liabilities from U$S 573 billion to U$S 285 billion (-50%), and from this process emerged new ordinary shares and four series of Negotiable Obligations (ONs), two at par (with and without public offering) with maturity in 2016, and two others with discount (also with and without public offering) with maturity in 2015. In turn, a cash payment was made equivalent to 24% of the capital of the debt in force at 55% of its nominal value. With respect to ONs with public offering (par and with discount) Fitch Ratings assigned them a rating of B (arg).

In the secondary market of corporate debt instruments, a clear and even greater differentiation continues to be observed between debtors that adhered to the fulfillment of their financial obligations and those that had to resort to the restructuring of their debts after defaulting following the 2001-02 crisis. In terms of TIR, the additional premium required for ONs issued after restructuring processes was positioned on average at 2.6 p.p., 0.4 p.p. higher with respect to the previous month (see Graph 6.2.4.1).

Financial Trusts (FF) emerged in Argentina in 1996 as a mechanism by which securities are issued, guaranteeing the repayment of capital and interest through the cash flow generated by a specific asset portfolio, which was previously transferred (in fiduciary ownership) to a trust (operation called securitization or securitization) (see Diagram 6.2.5.1). Since its inception, this alternative financing mechanism has been gaining relevance, being increasingly used by companies as a financing mechanism and increasingly sought by investors. Only in 2004 were funds channeled for approximately $2,000 million (5% of the total bank loans granted to the private sector that year), and volumes significantly higher are projected for the present year. The growing relevance that this new form of financial intermediation, different from banking, is acquiring makes it necessary to monitor it when analyzing credit in the economy.

 were placed in the month, of which more than 50%
 corresponded to the securitization of personal loans, in line
 with the trend observed during the year. In the accumulated January-
 July personal loans represent 44% of the total underlying

 credit cards (11%) (see Chart 6.2.5.2).
